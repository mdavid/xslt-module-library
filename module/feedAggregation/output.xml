      <title>Reading isn't comprehending</title>
      <link>http://www.scripting.com/2006/08/16.html#readingIsntComprehending</link>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;A note to &lt;a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/08/the_great_unrea.php"&gt;Nick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://publishing2.com/2006/08/16/blogging-is-the-new-novel-screenplay-writing/"&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=258"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;, and people who think the number of people who "read" your blog means anything... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to do a study to see if people can tell you what a blog post said some short interval after reading it. Something like the SAT, for blog readers. I bet the numbers would be astonishingly small. I have reasons to believe that almost no one actually reads this stuff. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A story I like to tell. Once I wrote a short bit explaining why I like a certain web technology that people are somewhat fanatic about. I got flamed, en masse, by people who thought I was dissing it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another. I can't tell you how many times I get emails that "solve" a supposed "problem" that is discussed in the first sentence or two of a post, where the solution is explained in the third or fourth sentence. I conclude from that that people read something, it triggers one of their canned responses, and before reading the rest of the post, they're typing the answer in their email app, or asking for more info, when the info is in the next sentence of the blog post, the part they didn't bother to read. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think a lot of people skim quickly and click on links, skim quickly and then hit the back button, then hit the back button again. So what's the point of being on the A-list if no one reads, they just scan. (And guess what they're scanning for, their name, of course!) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I really value is new information or ideas that I receive from reading blogs. I don't care so much about being heard, because I know from experience that there really isn't very much of that going on. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://publishing2.com/2006/08/16/blogging-is-the-new-novel-screenplay-writing/"&gt;Scott Karp&lt;/a&gt;: "Even if no one reads this post, I feel better having written it."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So to Scott, that may be the only joy available from blogging, the satisfaction of getting something off your chest. It really can be therapeutic, and also, having written it, you can then move on to the next thing, and the next thing after that. By writing something you really have to think it through. &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Oft-repeated hype</title>
      <link>http://www.scripting.com/2006/08/16.html#oftrepeatedHype</link>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;The problem with Wikipedia hype is that the proponents over-sell, and they're often smart people so maybe they'll stop doing it if I point it out. Here's an &lt;a href="http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/wikipedias_credibility.html"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;blockquote&gt;Simply appearing in the Encyclopedia Britannica confers authority on an article. Simply appearing in Wikipedia does not, because you might hit the 90 second stretch before some loon's rewriting of history or science is found and fixed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone who hasn't spent the last 30 years online might not understand that it's equally possible that the looney version of the story might be the one that gets reverted to, after someone who knows the subject edits it to represent more than the single point of view of the troll who's camped out on the article, or the group of trolls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've seen so many articles on Wikipedia on subjects that I know that are just plain wrong, and when I try to fix it, the fix gets undone within minutes. Sorry I'm not willing to commit my life, or a big portion of it, to a Wikipedia page. So mistakes live on, sometimes big ones. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is value in Wikipedia, but please, let's not undermine other approaches, let's not put unnecessary barriers in their way. Wikipedia has been so successful that we're in danger of going back to a monoculture. We're trading a bad system, imho, for an even worse one. &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>I was wrong</title>
      <link>http://www.scripting.com/2006/08/16.html#iWasWrong</link>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/08/14.html#inspirationFromNewPlaces"&gt;On Monday, I wrote&lt;/a&gt;: "They're different from us, but you can't tell from looking at them, because they look exactly like us, unlike black people who usually have darker skin."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From Walter Purvis, via email: "As I understand it, the 'us' in that sentence is Americans. Now re-read that sentence pretending you're a &lt;i&gt;black&lt;/i&gt; American. It's funny how racial biases creep into our thinking so subtly, isn't it?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gulp. That is correct. What I said was wrong, and I'm sorry I said it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2006/08/16/aaronCardBig.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2006/08/16/aaronCard.jpg" width="85" height="121" border="0" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="5" alt="A picture named aaronCard.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What I was trying to say made no sense, and it did occur to me as I was writing it. Canadians look so much like us that there are Canadians of all colors and countries of origin, just like people from the United States. In my defense, I was thinking about racial contrast because the first part of the piece was about Jackie Robinson and the integration of baseball. And I did say that Robinson and I both come from the same country. But Mr Purvis noticed something that I didn't, and he is correct, and very generous in his criticism, and I appreciate that very much. because it makes it easier to say I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Computers crash</title>
      <link>http://www.scripting.com/2006/08/16.html#computersCrash</link>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/08/15.html#yesVirginiaMacsCrashToo"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about Macintoshes and how they crash, as all computers do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2006/08/16/g5.jpg" width="125" height="184" border="0" align="right" hspace="3" vspace="1" alt="A picture named g5.jpg"&gt;No one, even the most idiotic Mac idiot, disputes that Macs crash. They disagree on whether it's my fault or whether I got a bad Mac (obviously I did, two of them). I don't run any unusual software, and I don't install experimental stuff on my computer. I'm really conservative. I know what it's like to live on the edge, I used to write drivers and other system-level software, a long time ago. These days it's Firefox and OPML, Handbrake, Azureus, The Sims (v 2), Flickr Uploader, VLC, iTunes. I have an HP printer and scanner, iChat, TextEdit. The computer that crashes is a dual CPU G5, bought virtually at the end of its lifecycle, so it should be well burned in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.scripting.com/archiveScriptingCom/2006/08/16/g5otherway.jpg" width="125" height="184" border="0" align="right" hspace="3" vspace="1" alt="A picture named g5otherway.jpg"&gt;But all this michegas is beside the point (which most people seem to have missed, even though it was pretty clearly written). I know computers crash. There's no such thing as an architecture that can't crash (even toasters &lt;a href="http://www.fire.org.uk/BBC_News/News2004/March/bbc020304e.htm"&gt;catch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/fire_safety/recalls/detail.asp?id=386"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.consumeraffairs.com/recalls/applica.html"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, no one's fault, shit happens). That's why its irresponsible for Apple to advertise that Macs don't crash. I'm not a lawyer, but it seems fraudulent to me. And as a programmer, it's really tempting fate to make such a claim. Bad Murphy karma. Put it this way, if you were a pilot, would you fly a plane if the manufacturer said it can't crash? How much faith would you have in their support system if you thought they really believed that??&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>India's Cut-Price Space Program</title>

      <summary>&lt;strong&gt;Xeni Jardin&lt;/strong&gt;: Wired News is running a special series by Chennai-based tech journalist Scott Carney about India's "I can get it into orbit for you wholesale" space program: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.wired.com/indiaspace/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://boingboing.net/images/P1010593.jpg" width="225" height="223" align="left" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Every launch resonates deeply in patriotic nerve centers and causes celebrations throughout the country. Some cities fire off so many fireworks the sky stays thick with smoke for hours. In other places, people pray for the success of the mission in temples and mosques. They may not know what's on board the rocket, but its liftoff certainly lends credibility to India. &lt;p&gt; Still, India's rocket scientists are humble about their work. Launching missiles with massive payloads into space is a tricky business and things can go wrong at any stage. &lt;p&gt; After 11 consecutive successful launches, the most recent launch of India's Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle on July 10 had to be aborted when one of the engines failed. But these sorts of setbacks are par for the course in the space business -- and aren't confined to India. In 2003, a similar satellite launch by Brazil's space agency resulted in disaster when the rocket exploded on the launch pad, killing 21 technicians and briefly forcing the country to suspend its space program. &lt;p&gt; To keep the odds in their favor, some scientists make pilgrimages to the famous Venkateswara temple in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, with a small bronze replica of the payload. The model is sprinkled with holy water and placed in front of an idol of Vishnu to be blessed for success. &lt;p&gt; "Once you are airborne there is not time to make changes," said Rajeev Lochan, assistant science secretary of ISRO. "Maybe it helps to have the divine in your corner."&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/space/0,71399-0.html?tw=wn_index_20"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.

The 'Original Biography' must be reconstructed from the New Testament where Satan is the same sort of celestial functionary we see in the Book of Job - appointed to govern the world, specifically to monitor and test human beings. But he is brutal and deceitful in his methods, and Jesus predicts that his rule will soon come to an end.

Along with &lt;a href="http://www.eff.org/Privacy/AOL/spreadtheword.php"&gt;spreading the word about this debacle&lt;/a&gt;, you can take steps to protect yourself online. (...) [W]e've listed some tips and tools that will help keep your search history private.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't put &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information"&gt;personally-identifying information&lt;/a&gt; in your searches&lt;/em&gt;, at least not in a way that can be associated with your other searches. You should take the precautions below to avoid giving away your identity to your search engine anyway, but they're especially necessary if you want to do a search to see if your personal information has appeared online or want to do a vanity search for your name. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don't use a search engine operated by your ISP.&lt;/em&gt; Most ISPs inherently know who their users are, at any given time and over the long run. If you use their default search tool, they know who you are and everything you search for. Use someone else's search tool instead.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Continued &lt;a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004868.php"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

The public would be able to take surveys "about all things related to the movies -- from theater attendance to homevideo rental and advertisements to piracy." &lt;p&gt; Well, guess what topic they want to talk about first? &lt;p&gt; Their very first survey launched today, and started with a few simple personality-questions -- what's your favorite movie, what's your favorite movie quote, etc. Then suddenly it switched gears and became an obvious push-poll. I took screengrabs of the loaded survey questions and put them at the above ImageShack URL.

(For the unfamiliar: Originally a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=boingboing06-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;location=%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F185715133X%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1155771159%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3Fie%3DUTF8"&gt;novel by Vladimir Nabokov&lt;/a&gt;, "Lolita" tells the story of a Humbert Humbert, an older professor who falls obsessively in love with his landlady's 12-year-old daughter.) &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&amp;amp;tag=boingboing06-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;location=%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB00005ATQH%2Fsr%3D8-4%2Fqid%3D1155771159%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_4%3Fie%3DUTF8"&gt;first film adaptation of "Lolita"&lt;/a&gt; was directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1962. As a concession to the MPAA, Kubrick raised Lolita's age to fourteen, and largely desexualized her relationship with Humbert. As directed by Adrian Lyne (9 1/2 Weeks, Fatal Attraction), the 1997 version attempted to be truer to the source novel in those respects, and even showed a topless Lolita in the bedroom with Humbert. &lt;p&gt; This is where my co-worker came in. Since the filmmakers were not legally able to film their underage actress topless in a sexual situation, they filmed her with a beige body stocking with X's of electrical tape where her nipples would have been. They then re-filmed the same scene with a rather busty (but entirely legal) 18-year-old actress. My friend was then given the task of seamlessly tracking and compositing the nekkid 18-year-old bosoms onto the 14-year-old body. &lt;p&gt; Obviously there's a difference between a professional VFX artist performing such manipulation for the sake of art, and some anonymous perv performing such manipulation for the sake of, er, self-manipulation. But how does one discriminate between these two goals? And more importantly, how does one /legally/ differentiate them? Defining what is and isn't "art" has never been something that the legal system has shown itself to be particularly adept at. &lt;p&gt; And how does the quality of the representation affect that judgement? If a photograph can be deemed pornographic, is a stick figure rendering of the same scene also pornographic? And if not, at what point between those two poles (symbolic / photo-realistic) does the threshold fall? What about an obviously poor photo composite? Or highly realistic, but entirely synthetic vector art, such has recently been popular on the internets? &lt;p&gt; Regardless of these quandaries, rest assured that so long as the technology exists to create such imagery, someone, somewhere will be busy creating it.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Previously: &lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/16/uk_man_faces_jail_ov.html"&gt; UK man faces jail over 'made-up' child porn images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;Reader comment: &lt;/font&gt; Blender says, &lt;blockquote&gt;It would be worthwhile checking out Brit comedian Chris Morris's 'Brass Eye' special, which satirised British media hysteria surrounding such issues. There's a fantastic scene featuring an interview in an art gallery. The episode was aired on Channel 4 and received record numbers of complaints but also a lot of critical acclaim. Many politicians and media pundits described it as 'shocking' but then later had to admit to having not seen the programme.... Interesting.... &lt;a href="http://www.spikedhumor.com/articles/8087/Brass_Eye_2001_Special_Padeogeddon_Full_Episode.html"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt; W.

Over the years Bold Type was a party in two cases that made it to the US Surpreme Court; the first one we lost, but the second -- Ashcroft v Free Speech Coalition (00-795) -- resulted in the sections of the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 that criminalized 'virtual' child pornography being declared unconstitutional: &lt;a href="http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-795.ZO.html"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?a=Aoek4z"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?i=Aoek4z" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/16/more_on_the_legaliti.html</entry>

      <summary>&lt;strong&gt;Xeni Jardin&lt;/strong&gt;: China's state administration of Radio, Film, and TV has issued new rules that ban websites from distributing short films without government approval. &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.yesasia.com/en/PrdDept.aspx/pid-1003943854/section-videos/code-c/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://boingboing.net/images/p1003943854.jpg" width="140" height="204" align="left" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The administration has listed several well-known Websites, such as Sina, Sohu and Netease, as authorized providers of online video programs. But others face an uncertain fate as the administration will inspect the online video content they release and take strict measures to prevent any malpractice. &lt;p&gt; (...) A 10-minute video using clips from "Sparkling Red Star" [image at left], a 1974 film about the Chinese revolution, is the most recent short to draw a huge audience and plenty of criticism. Pan Dongzi, a heroic boy in the original movie, is portrayed as a popstar wannabe who competes in a televised singing contest. The video has attracted millions of viewers. ... Some commentators have argued satire should not go too far and the distortion of heroes and China's revolutionary history is immoral and unacceptable. &lt;p&gt; According to an online survey, more than 60 percent of Web users who have watched it agree that a parody should remain within bounds."&lt;br clear="all"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shanghaidaily.com/art/2006/08/17/289373/Approval_needed_for_Website_short_films.htm"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;.

      <summary>&lt;strong&gt;David Pescovitz&lt;/strong&gt;: My friend Mike Love, newly living in sin, trash-picked an excellent vintage volume from the The Practical Encyclopedia of Good Decorating and Home Improvement (1970).

      <summary>&lt;strong&gt;Mark Frauenfelder&lt;/strong&gt;: A Vermont professor had 12 years of Shakespeare research confiscated at Heathrow. &lt;P&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bradleysalmanac.com"&gt;Brad Searles&lt;/a&gt; says &lt;blockquote&gt;An article describing the experience of a Vermont-based St. Michael's College professor Nick Clary as he tried to return home from London on the day the new restrictions were enacted. Officials confiscated thousands of pages of his research on Shakespeare, which was contained on three thumb-sized flash drives. &lt;blockquote&gt;The English professor was halted at one of the many security checkpoints. An airport official looked suspiciously at the three rectangular flash drives Clary had emptied from his pockets and placed in a plastic bin. &lt;P&gt;"No, you can't have them," the British Airways official told Clary. The uniformed woman nodded toward a large garbage bag, where banned items were being thrown out by the dozens. &lt;P&gt;After a few tense moments, Clary persuaded officials not to discard his research. Instead, the tiny files were placed inside Clary's eyeglass case, which were then put into a clear plastic bag and ticketed with a baggage claim check bound for Baltimore.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006608120313"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?a=H27xqY"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?i=H27xqY" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/16/airport_officials_se.html</entry>

I would love to take this trip. &lt;blockquote&gt;RAKAHANGA &lt;P&gt;There are few written accounts of life on Rakahanga. An Englishman, Julian Dashwood, who went there for a year in the early 1930s, reported that food was frequently a problem since it consisted chiefly of coconuts and fish. In his book which he wrote under the nom-de-plume of Julian Hillas, "South Seas Paradise" he said: &lt;P&gt;"I spent a year on Rakahanga and put on 18 pounds, which I lost again within six months of leaving. I developed a marvellous appetite and have never felt better than I did during that period." &lt;P&gt;He attributed this mainly to the fish and coconuts which formed 80 per cent of his diet, as well as a complete absence of worry in any form. He wrote in 1964: &lt;P&gt;"Looking back over nearly 30 years, I still give Rakahanga top rating. If there are places left where a man can grow old contentedly, it is on some such quiet, drowsy atoll, where today is forever and tomorrow never comes; where men live and die, feast and sorrow, while the winds and the waves play over wet sands and gleaming reefs."&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/islomaniacs/message/265"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?a=jTCyBd"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?i=jTCyBd" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/16/tour_remote_south_pa.html</entry>

      <summary>&lt;strong&gt;David Pescovitz&lt;/strong&gt;: Missed this while on holiday last week, but there's another Philip K. Dick biopic in pre-production. (I &lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/02/philip_k_dick_biopic.html"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a couple weeks ago about Panasonic, to be directed by Matthew Wilder and starring Bill Pullman.) Dick's estate is producing this other biopic with a screenplay by Tony Grisoni who helped bring the drug-fueled tale Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to the big screen. According to Sci Fi Wire, Paul Giamatti is in negotiations to fill PKD's shoes. &lt;a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=37440"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Thanks, Dave Gill!)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?a=Ms1Hp5"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?i=Ms1Hp5" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/16/another_philip_k_dic.html</entry>

      <summary>&lt;strong&gt;David Pescovitz&lt;/strong&gt;: Our solar system may have at least twelve planets, including Charon, Ceres, and 2003 UB313 (AKA Xena). That's based on an official definition of planet now being debated at the International Astronomical Union meeting in Prague. According to the definition, Pluto, Charon, and certain other small objects with tilted orbits would be deemed planets but part of a separate class called "Plutons." Astronomers will vote on the proposed definition next week. From National Geographic: &lt;blockquote&gt;The IAU proposal says that a planet is an object large enough to have become rounded due to the force of its own gravity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But it's not that simple. What counts as a planet also depends on what it's orbiting around. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A planet has to orbit a star, so rounded objects floating freely through space won't make the cut. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But if an object is orbiting another, much larger object that's not a star, it wouldn't count as a planet either. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Astrophysicist Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., is... critical of the proposed definition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "It doesn't have the elegance I was hoping for," Boss said. "It looks like it was written by a committee of lawyers rather than scientists." &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/060816-pluto-planet.html"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?a=rim14Y"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?i=rim14Y" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/16/word_planet_to_be_de.html</entry>

      <summary>&lt;strong&gt;David Pescovitz&lt;/strong&gt;: In these short excerpts from a 1977 interview conducted at the "Festival du livre de science fiction," surrealist SF author Philip K. Dick talks about paranoia during the Nixon administration, the Berkeley counterculture, and A Scanner Darkly. From the interview, incorporated into a video made to promote the recent film adaptation of A Scanner Darkly: &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;img src="http://www.boingboing.net/images/dickinterview.jpg" height="83" width="137" border="1" align="left" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="Dickinterview" /&gt; The positions that writers such as myself hold in America are... very lowly.

      <summary>&lt;strong&gt;David Pescovitz&lt;/strong&gt;: NASA &lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;lost&lt;/span&gt; can't seem to find right now 13,000 original tapes of the Apollo moon missions, including footage of Neil Armstrong's "giant leap." Apparently, the quality of the raw reels is several times better than the ghosty images caused by reformatting for TV broadcast. From the Associated Press: &lt;blockquote&gt; Until Tuesday, the search for the tapes was a spare-time deal and retirement hobby for (Goddard engineer Richard) Nafzger and the 81-year-old (retired NASA TV camera manager Stan) Lebar - not anything organized. Now with news reports of the lost tapes and NASA wanting data for its new lunar missions, the agency ordered a search of its cosmic attics...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Starting in 1970, the tapes were shipped to the National Archives' massive record center in Suitland, Md. And Lebar had hoped he hit pay dirt when he went to the record center, which he compared to the massive warehouse of long-forgotten boxes seen in the final scene of the movie "Raiders of the Lost Ark."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; But when Lebar got to the area the boxes were supposed to be, he found empty shelves. Later, he and Nafzger determined all the boxes were returned permanently to Goddard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "They're not lost," Lebar said, "it's just we haven't gotten to the next step yet." &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/technology/ebusiness/feeds/ap/2006/08/15/ap2952087.html"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/font&gt; National Public Radio did a recent piece on the search for the tapes with interesting detail about why the footage looked so crappy on TV. From NPR: &lt;blockquote&gt;To convert the originals, engineers essentially took a commercial television camera and aimed it at the monitor. The resulting image is what was sent to Houston, and on to the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "And any time you just point a camera at a screen, that's obviously not the best way to get the best picture," says Richard Nafzger, a TV specialist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. He worked with Apollo's lunar TV program, and says that conversion was the best they could do at the time.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5578853"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Thanks, Nicolas Soichet!)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?a=JLWfnW"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?i=JLWfnW" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/16/nasa_cant_find_moon_.html</entry>

Highlights included: &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;15 hours later, our plane was cancelled while sitting in the place and after they served food. &lt;LI&gt;The plane cancelled flew to our destination without us, only to pick up more passengers, Boston to London. &lt;LI&gt;I was behind the counter making reservations. &lt;LI&gt;Many were crying on the floor. &lt;LI&gt;The airline could not re-book for us, but we could call and re-book, what crap! &lt;/UL&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;So, I went through 3 security checks but some unlucky individuals went through more if they were randomly selected. The security line was long, 2-3+ hours each. The first line was for checking in luggage, which was your only chance to check in everything and only carry on what was allowed (many people tried cheating this). The second line was the first security check to get into the terminals with x-rays, pat downs, and hand searches into your only plastic bag. This is also where a great deal of good were thrown away. There was a trashbag on the floor full of cell phones, ipods, cameras, jewelry, razors, notebooks, usb sticks, key fobs, lipstick, some really expensive pens, and many other items that would be hard to throw away.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.designverb.com/2006/08/15/stuck-at-heathrow-airport-experience/"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?a=GntxRP"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?i=GntxRP" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/16/hideous_heathrow_exp.html</entry>

      <summary>&lt;strong&gt;Xeni Jardin&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.kenzoid.com"&gt;Ken Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; says, &lt;blockquote&gt;A computer expert in Great Britain has been told to “be prepared, at least, for a prison sentence”. His crime? He scanned photographs of adult porn stars into his computer, and photomanipulated them to reduce the size of their breasts and add schoolgirl costumes. Again...pictures *of adults* photoshopped. No actual children involved, and no one is asserting otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He pled guilty after being told "a pseudophotograph of a child is defined as an image, whether made by computer graphics or otherwise, which appears to be that of a child. Such an image is treated in law as showing a child even if some of the physical characteristics are those of an adult. "&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At an earlier court hearing, even the judge the analogy of a “tarts and vicars” party...would photos from women at such an event be considered child pornography?&lt;/p&gt; (Note: I originally found the link from a &lt;a href="http://www.secondlife.com"&gt;Second Life&lt;/a&gt; member's blog where they were discussing related issues &lt;a href="http://www.secondlifeinsider.com/2006/08/15/age-play-rights-and-risks/"&gt;as they are related to Second Life&lt;/a&gt;. A notable quote from that blogpost: &lt;q&gt;I can't help thinking that his offence pales into insignificance next to the sort of activity that happens in SL. &lt;/q&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;a href="http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20411-2306067.html"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; to UK Times story. Another interesting snip from that piece: computer forensic analyst Ray Savage, with the Cleveland police department -- "These images can be as crude as someone having pasted a cut-out of a child’s head on to an adult’s photo."&lt;p&gt; &lt;font color="red"&gt;Reader comment:&lt;/font&gt; Kyle Marriott says, &lt;blockquote&gt;Thought you might like to hear a little story, because I too am caught up in something very similar and a little more worring. &lt;p&gt; Some years ago, I did HTML and graphic work on a website for a few friends of mine. It was never intended to be anything commercial, just a small site for them to attempt to be 'funny on the Internets' for their friends. &lt;p&gt; It turns out that in the early days of seeking popularity, they decided to batch upload a load of hentai (basically Japanese cartoon porn). Some of this is a little disturbing, as seems to be the case with anything combining the words 'Japanese' and 'erotic', but nothing that seemed to be illegal; they even got their hosts to check to make sure nothing was going to get them in any trouble. &lt;p&gt; This sat fine for almost three years, until the registrar of the domain, my friend Michael, got a knock on his door at 7am. The police were stood there with a warrant to search his house and seize his computers. They did the same at his parent's house, and then arrested him for distribution of abusive images of children. &lt;p&gt; Since then, they've requested that the other friend go in for questioning, and then also myself. We both had all of our computers and hard drives seized too, as well as being arrested and bailed. All of this over a few cartoons, which whilst being admittedly graphic, are not in my eyes abusive to children. &lt;p&gt; This was over 3 months ago. The investigating officers don't have an answerphone, do not return my calls, and it took me over a week to get through to someone to update my address when I moved to a new apartment. Since then, the only contact they've given me has been a voicemail to tell me not to come in for my bail date because the Crown Prosecution Service can't decide whether the case can go to court. That was three weeks ago, and I haven't been able to get in touch with anyone since. &lt;p&gt; Right now I'm left wondering if I'm still on bail, whether I can leave the country for a holiday, and whether I'm actually going to be charged and put on the sex offender's register or not. I think that this country really needs to review it's policies and laws with regards to this, as every day I read about real paedophiles who hurt children getting slack sentences and leniency whilst I'm left in the dark over a few drawings.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?a=LsJ7Xi"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/boingboing/iBag?i=LsJ7Xi" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/16/uk_man_faces_jail_ov.html</entry>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;I should have been clearer. My new blog is over on WordPress's new hosted service, which is still in beta. I've been posting frequently over there. &lt;a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/"&gt;http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm still playing around, though, and learning the new system. I'm also setting up a separate blog over on TypePad to learn that blog tool. And have yet another one over on DABU too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh, and of course, there's &lt;a href="http://www.nakedconversations.com"&gt;our book blog&lt;/a&gt; (which is also on TypePad) and the Channel 9 video blog, done on modified version of Community Server. So, I'm getting around to a variety of blog tools and services. I find I don't like a lot about all the tools. It's interesting to me that no one has really come out with a big blog breakthrough lately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm getting another demo of Flock tomorrow, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh, and ou might check in on &lt;a href="http://channel9.msdn.com"&gt;Channel 9&lt;/a&gt;. I just uploaded three videos, including my first Xbox 360 one, an interview with a Vice President in charge of half of our developer division (we're shipping Visual Studio "within days" I hear).&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <summary>&lt;font face="Georgia"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re trying to get a team all working in the same direction, we’ve seen that &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/08.html"&gt;Command and Control management&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/09.html"&gt;Econ 101 management&lt;/a&gt; both fail pretty badly in high tech, knowledge- oriented teams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That leaves a technique that I’m going to have to call The Identity Method. The goal here is to manage by making people &lt;i&gt;identify&lt;/i&gt; with the goals you’re trying to achieve. That’s a lot trickier than the other methods, and it requires some serious interpersonal skills to pull off. But if you do it right, it works better than any other method.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem with Econ 101 management is that it subverts intrinsic motivation. The Identity Method is a way to &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt; intrinsic motivation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be an Identity Method manager, you have to summon all the social skills you have to make your employees identify with the goals of the organization, so that they are highly motivated, then you need to give them the information they need to steer in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How do you make people identify with the organization? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It helps if the organizational goals are virtuous, or perceived as virtuous, in some way. Apple creates almost fanatic identification, almost entirely through a narrative that started with a single Superbowl ad in 1984: we are against totalitarianism. Doesn’t seem like a particularly bold position to take, but it worked. Here at Fog Creek, we stand bravely in opposition to killing kittens. Yaaaay!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" alt="" src="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/10lunch.JPG" align="right" border="0" /&gt;A method I’m pretty comfortable with is eating together. I’ve always made a point of eating lunch with my coworkers, and at Fog Creek we serve catered lunches for the whole team every day and eat together at one big table. It’s hard to understate what a big impact this has on making the company feel like a family, in the good way, I think. In six years, nobody has ever quit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m probably going to freak out some of our summer interns by admitting this, but one the goals of our internship program is to make people identify as New Yorkers, so they’re more comfortable with the idea of moving here after college and working for us full-time. We do this through a pretty exhausting list of extra-curricular summer activities: two Broadway shows, a trip to the Top of the Rock, a boat ride around Manhattan, a Yankees game, an open house so they can meet more New Yorkers, and a trip to a museum; Michael and I host parties in our apartments, both as a way of welcoming the interns but also as a way for interns to visualize living in an apartment in New York, not just the dorm we stuck them in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" alt="" src="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/10interns.JPG" align="right" border="0" /&gt;In general, Identity Management requires you to create a cohesive, jelled team that feels like a family, so that people have a sense of loyalty and commitment to their coworkers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second part, though, is to give people the information they need to steer the organization in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier today Brett came into my office to discuss ship dates for FogBugz 6.0. He was sort of leaning towards April 2007; I was sort of leaning towards December 2006. Of course, if we shipped in April, we would have time to do a lot more polishing, and improve a lot of areas of the product; if we shipped in December, we’d probably have to cut a bunch of nice new features.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I explained to Brett, though, is that we want to hire six new people in the spring, and the chances that we’ll be able to afford them without FogBugz 6.0 are much smaller. So the way I concluded the meeting with Brett was to make him understand the exact financial motivations I have for shipping earlier, and now that he knows that, I’m confident he’ll make the right decision... not necessarily &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; decision. Maybe we’ll have a big upswing in sales without FogBugz 6.0, and now that Brett understands the basic financial parameters, he’ll realize that maybe that means we can hold 6.0 for a few more features. The point being that by sharing information, I can get Brett to do the right thing for Fog Creek even if circumstances change. If I tried to push him around by offering him a cash reward for every day before April that he ships, his incentive would be to dump the existing buggy development build on the public &lt;i&gt;tonight&lt;/i&gt;. If I tried to push him around using Command and Control management by ordering him to ship bug free code on time, &lt;i&gt;dammit&lt;/i&gt;, he might do it, but he’d hate his job and leave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are as many different styles of management as there are managers. I’ve identified three major styles: two easy, dysfunctional styles and one hard, functional style, but the truth is that many development shops manage in more of an ad-hoc, “whatever works” way that may change from day to day or person to person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Joel is on vacation.

      <summary>&lt;font face="Georgia"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joke:&lt;/b&gt; A poor Jew lived in the shtetl in 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century Russia. A Cossack comes up to him on horseback. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What are you feeding that chicken?” asks the Cossack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Just some bread crumbs,” replies the Jew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How dare you feed a fine Russian chicken such lowly food!” says the Cossack, and hits the Jew with a stick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next day the Cossack comes back. “Now what are you feeding that chicken?” ask the Jew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Well, I give him three courses. There’s freshly cut grass, fine sturgeon caviar, and a small bowl of heavy cream sprinkled with imported French chocolate truffles for dessert.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Idiot!” says the Cossack, beating the Jew with a stick. “How dare you waste good food on a lowly chicken!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the third day, the Cossack again asks, “What are you feeding that chicken?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Nothing!” pleads the Jew. “I give him a kopeck and he buys whatever he wants.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(pause for laughter)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(no?)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(ba dum dum)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(still no laughter)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(oh well).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" alt="" src="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/09candy.JPG" align="right" border="0" /&gt;I use the term “Econ 101” a little bit tongue-in-cheek. For my non-American readers: most US college departments have a course numbered “101” which is the basic introductory course for any field. Econ 101 management is the style used by people who know just enough economic theory to be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Econ 101 manager assumes that everyone is motivated by money, and that the best way to get people to do what you want them to do is to give them financial rewards and punishments to create incentives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, AOL might pay their call-center people for every customer they persuade &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to cancel their subscription.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A software company might give bonuses to programmers who create the fewest bugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It works about as well as giving your chickens money to buy their own food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One big problem is that it replaces intrinsic motivation with extrinsic motivation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intrinsic motivation is your own, natural desire to do things well. People usually start out with a lot of intrinsic motivation. They want to do a good job. They &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to help people understand that it’s in their best interest to keep paying AOL $24 a month. They &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to write less-buggy code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Extrinsic motivation is a motivation that comes from outside, like when you’re paid to achieve something specific.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intrinsic motivation is much stronger than extrinsic motivation. People work much harder at things that they &lt;i&gt;actually want to do&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;That’s not very controversial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But when you offer people money to do things that they wanted to do, anyway, they suffer from something called the Overjustification Effect. “I must be writing bug-free code because I like the money I get for it,” they think, and the extrinsic motivation &lt;i&gt;displaces&lt;/i&gt; the intrinsic motivation. Since extrinsic motivation is a much weaker effect, the net result is that you’ve actually &lt;i&gt;reduced&lt;/i&gt; their desire to do a good job. When you stop paying the bonus, or when they decide they don’t care that much about the money, they no longer think that they care about bug free code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another big problem with Econ 101 management is the tendency for people to find local maxima. They’ll find some way to optimize for the specific thing you’re paying them, without actually achieving the thing you really want.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So for example your customer retention specialist, in his desire to earn the bonus associated with maintaining a customer, will drive the customer so crazy that the New York Times will run a big front page story about how nasty your customer “service” is. Although his behavior maximizes the thing you’re paying him for (customer retention) it doesn’t maximize the thing you really care about (profit). And then you try to reward him for the company profit, say, by giving him 13 shares of stock, and you realize that it’s not really something he controls, so it’s a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you use Econ 101 management, you’re encouraging developers to game the system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suppose you decide to pay a bonus to the developer with the fewest bugs. Now every time a tester tries to report a bug, it becomes a big argument, and usually the developer convinces the tester that it’s not really a bug. Or the tester agrees to report the bug “informally” to the developer before writing it up in the bug tracking system. And now nobody uses the bug tracking system. The bug count goes way down, but the number of bugs stays the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developers are clever this way. Whatever you try to measure, they’ll find a way to maximize, and you’ll never quite get what you want.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robert Austin, in his book &lt;em&gt;Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations&lt;/em&gt;, says there are two phases when you introduce new performance metrics. At first, you actually get what you wanted, because nobody has figured out how to cheat. In the second phase, you actually get something &lt;i&gt;worse&lt;/i&gt;, as everyone figures out the trick to maximizing the thing that you’re measuring, even at the cost of ruining the company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Worse, Econ 101 managers think that they can somehow avoid this situation just by tweaking the metrics. Dr. Austin’s conclusion is that you just &lt;i&gt;can’t&lt;/i&gt;. It never works. No matter how much you try to adjust the metrics to reflect what you think you want, it always backfires.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with Econ 101 management, though, is that it’s not management at all: it’s really more of an abdication of management. A deliberate refusal to figure out how things can be made better. It’s a sign that management simply doesn’t know how to teach people to do better work, so they force everybody in the system to come up with their own way of doing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of training developers on techniques of writing reliable code, you just absolve yourself of responsibility by paying them if they do. Now every developer has to figure it out on their own. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" alt="" src="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/09charbucks.JPG" align="right" border="0" /&gt;For more mundane tasks, working the counter at Starbucks or answering phone calls at AOL, it’s pretty unlikely that the average worker will figure out a better way of doing things on their own. You can go into any coffee shop in the country and order a short soy caramel latte extra-hot, and you’ll find that you have to keep repeating your order again and again: once to the coffee maker, again to the coffee maker when they forgot what you said, and finally to the cashier so they can figure out what to charge you. That’s the result of nobody telling the workers a better way. Nobody figures it out, except Starbucks, where the standard training involves a complete system of naming, writing things on cups, and calling out orders which insures that customers only have to specify their drink orders once. The system, invented by Starbucks HQ, works great, but workers at the other chains never, ever come up with it on their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your customer service people spend most of the day talking to customers. They don’t have the time, the inclination, or the training to figure out better ways to do things. Nobody in the customer retention crew is going to be able to keep statistics and measure which customer retention techniques work best while pissing off the fewest bloggers. They just don’t care enough, they’re not smart enough, they don’t have enough information, and they are too busy with their real job. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a manager it’s your job to figure out a system. That’s Why You Get The Big Bucks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you read a little bit too much Ayn Rand as a kid, or if you took one semester of Economics, before they explained that utility is not measured in dollars, you may think that setting up simplified bonus schemes and Pay For Performance is a pretty neat way to manage. But it doesn’t work. Start doing your job managing and stop feeding your chickens kopecks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Joel!” you yell. “Yesterday you told us that the developers should make all the decisions. Today you’re telling us that the managers should make all the decisions. What’s up with that?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mmm, not exactly. Yesterday I told you that your developers, the leaves in the tree, have the most information; micromanagement or Command and Control barking out orders is likely to cause non-optimal results. Today I’m telling you that when you’re creating a system, you can’t abdicate your responsibility to train your people by bribing them. Management, in general, needs to set up the system so that people can get things done, it needs to avoid displacing intrinsic motivation with extrinsic motivation, and it won’t get very far using fear and barking out specific orders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that I’ve shot down Command and Control management and Econ 101 management, there’s one more method managers can use to get people moving in the right direction. I call it the Identity method and I’ll talk about it more tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Joel is on vacation. This episode was pre-recorded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</summary>

      <summary>&lt;font face="Georgia"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/1995/luvaas.pdf"&gt;Frederick the Great [PDF]&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; “Soldiers should fear their officers more than all the dangers to which they are exposed.... Good will can never induce the common soldier to stand up to such dangers; he will only do so through fear.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Command and Control form of management is based on military management. Primarily, the idea is that people do what you tell them to do, and if they don’t, you yell at them until they do, and if they still don’t, you throw them in the brig for a while, and if that doesn’t teach them, you put them in charge of peeling onions on a submarine, sharing two cubit feet of personal space with a lad from a farm who really never quite learned about brushing his teeth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a million great techniques you can use. Rent the movies &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094746/"&gt;Biloxi Blues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084434/"&gt;An Officer and a Gentleman&lt;/a&gt; for some ideas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" alt="" src="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/08protest.JPG" align="right" border="0" /&gt;Some managers use this technique because they actually learned it in the military. Others grew up in authoritarian households or countries and think it’s a natural way to gain compliance. Others just don’t know any better. Hey, it works for the military, it should work for an internet startup!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are, it turns out, three drawbacks with this method in a high tech team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First of all, people don’t really like it very much, least of all smarty-pants software developers, who are, actually, pretty smart and are used to thinking they know more than everyone else, for perfectly good reasons, because it happens to be true, and so it really, really bothers them when they’re commanded to do something “because.” But that’s not really a good enough reason to discard this method… we’re trying to be rational here. High tech teams have many goals but making everyone happy is rarely goal number one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A more practical drawback with Command and Control is that management literally does not have enough time to micromanage at this level, because there simply aren’t enough managers. In the military, it’s possible to give an order simultaneously to a large team of people because it’s common that everyone is doing the same thing. “Clean your guns!” you can say, to a squad of 28, and then go take a brief nap and have a cool iced tea on the Officer’s Club veranda. In software development teams everybody is working on something else, so attempts to micromanage turn into &lt;b&gt;hit and run micromanagement&lt;/b&gt;. That’s where you micromanage one developer in a spurt of activity and then suddenly disappear from that developer’s life for a couple of weeks while you run around micromanaging other developers. The problem with hit and run micromanagement is that you don’t stick around long enough to see why your decisions are not working or to correct course. Effectively, all you accomplish is to knock your poor programmers off the train track every once in a while, so they spend the next week finding all their train cars and putting them back on the tracks and lining everything up again, a little bit battered from the experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The third drawback is that in a high tech company the individual contributors always have more information than the “leaders,” so they are really in the best position to make decisions. When the boss wanders into an office where two developers have been arguing for two hours about the best way to compress an image, the person with the &lt;i&gt;least&lt;/i&gt; information is the boss, so that’s the last person you’d want making a &lt;i&gt;technical&lt;/i&gt; decision. I remember when Mike Maples was my great grand-boss, in charge of Microsoft Applications, he was adamant about refusing to take sides on technical issues. Eventually people learned that they shouldn’t come to him to adjudicate. This forced people to debate the issue on the merits and issues were always resolved in favor of the person who was better at arguing, er, I mean, issues were always resolved in the best possible way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If Command and Control is such a bad way to run a team, why does the military use it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was explained to me in NCO school. I was in the Israeli paratroopers in 1986. Probably the worst paratrooper they ever had, now that I think back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" alt="" src="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/08dumbo.JPG" align="right" border="0" /&gt;There are several standing orders for soldiers. Number one: if you are in a mine field, &lt;i&gt;freeze&lt;/i&gt;. Makes sense, right? It was drilled into you repeatedly during basic training. Every once in a while the instructor would shout out “Mine!” and everybody had to freeze just so you would get in the habit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Standing order number two: when attacked, &lt;i&gt;run towards your attackers while shooting.&lt;/i&gt; The shooting makes them take cover so they can’t fire at you. Running towards them causes you to get closer to them, which makes it easier to aim at them, which makes it easier to kill them. This standing order makes a lot of sense, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, now for the Interview Question. What do you do if you’re in a minefield, and people start shooting at you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not such a hypothetical situation; it’s a really annoying way to get caught in an ambush.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The correct answer, it turns out, is that you ignore the minefield, and run towards the attackers while shooting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rationale behind this is that if you freeze, they’ll pick you off one at a time until you’re all dead, but if you charge, only some of you will die by running over mines, so for the greater good, that’s what you have to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trouble is that no rational soldier would charge under such circumstances. Each individual soldier has an enormous incentive to cheat: freeze in place and let the other, more macho soldiers do the charging. It’s sort of like a Prisoners’ Dilemma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In life or death situations, the military needs to make sure that they can shout orders and soldiers will obey them even if the orders are suicidal. That means soldiers need to be programmed to be obedient in a way which is not really all that important for, say, a software company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, the military uses Command and Control because it’s the only way to get 18 year olds to charge through a minefield, not because they think it’s the best management method for every situation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In particular, in software development teams where good developers can work anywhere they want, playing soldier is going to get &lt;i&gt;pret&lt;/i&gt;ty tedious and you’re not really going to keep anyone on your team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I’ll look at what I call the &lt;b&gt;Econ 101&lt;/b&gt; method of management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Joel is on vacation.

      <summary>&lt;font face="Georgia"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to lead a team, a company, an army, or a country, the primary problem you face is getting everyone moving in the same direction, which is really just a polite way of saying “getting people to do what you want.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think of it this way. As soon as your team consists of more than one person, you’re going to have different people with different agendas. They want different things than you want. If you’re a startup founder, you might want to make a lot of money quickly so you can retire early and spend the next couple of decades going to conferences for women bloggers. So you might spend most of your time driving around Sand Hill Road talking to VCs who might buy the company and flip it to Yahoo!. But Janice the Programmer, one of your employees, doesn’t care about selling out to Yahoo!, because she’s not going to make any money that way. What she cares about is writing code in the latest coolest new programming language, because it’s fun to learn a new thing. Meanwhile your CFO is entirely driven by the need to get out of the same cubicle he has been sharing with the system administrator, Trekkie Monster, and so he’s working up a new budget proposal that shows just how much money you would save by moving to larger office space that’s two minutes from his house, what a coincidence!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" alt="" src="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/07shirts.JPG" align="right" border="0" /&gt;The problem of getting people to move in &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; direction (or, at least, &lt;i&gt;the same&lt;/i&gt; direction) is not unique to startups, of course. It’s the same fundamental problem that a political leader faces when they get elected after promising to eliminate waste, corruption, and fraud in government. The mayor wants to make sure that it’s easy to get city approval of a new building project. The city building inspectors want to keep getting the bribes they have grown accustomed to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it’s the same problem that a military leader faces. They might want a team of soldiers to charge at the enemy, even when every individual soldier would really just rather cower behind a rock and let the others do the charging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are three common approaches you might take:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Command and Control&lt;/b&gt; Method&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Econ 101&lt;/b&gt; Method&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;Identity &lt;/b&gt;Method&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will certainly find other methods of management in the wild (there’s the exotic “Devil Wears Prada” Method, the Jihad Method, the Charismatic Cult Method, and the Lurch From One Method To Another Method) but over the next three days, I’m going to examine these three popular methods and explore their pros and cons. See you tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Joel is on vacation. This episode was pre-recorded.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</summary>

Are there plans for a second one in the works?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Good question! Recently I sat down with a long list of nominations and worked through them. When I was done, I was extremely depressed to discover that there wasn't enough material for a whole new book, and what I did find was 50% &lt;a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/"&gt;Stevey&lt;/a&gt;. It didn't seem fair to give him half the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There were five problems:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;div&gt;A lot of the good writing is taking place on blogs. Half the time, these blog entries are not written as essays but as quotes, hyperlinks, comments in discussion groups, all kinds of &lt;em&gt;hypertext&lt;/em&gt; that just doesn't hold together in plain text form. The old idea of an essay with a beginning, a middle, and an end is increasingly rare.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;div&gt;There's a lot of terrible writing out there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;div&gt;I'm not very good at finding the good writing that is probably out there somewhere, if only I could find it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;div&gt;I'm pretty crabby and have high standards, and slogging through gallons of bad writing just to find the occasional gem is something I don't think I'm going to live long enough to do.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;div&gt;A lot of programmers' magazines &lt;a href="http://www.ericsink.com/entries/Magazines_Dying.html"&gt;have disappeared&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and those that are left, like MSDN, have deteriorated to the point where I'd rather read the average Oracle knowledge base article (and I don't even USE Oracle).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In any case the bottom line is that another edition of "Best Software Writing" is not in the cards for '06. I'll revisit it next year. In the meantime, submit good articles to &lt;a href="http://joel.reddit.com"&gt;The Joel Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and keep voting over there; maybe some great stuff will float to the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</summary>

      <summary>&lt;font face="Georgia"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two small corrections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(1) When I said "crappy old FORTRAN really didn't even let you write functions," I really meant &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt; FORTRAN. There are newer versions of FORTRAN that are better than the last one I used, which was WATFOR, which I last used 27 years ago, so forgive my ignorance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(2) I wrote that the Google Mini was "communicating with Google to get PageRank information for public pages." It turns out that it doesn't. Today I spoke to the product managers over at Google and they told me that because of all the customers who want to use the Mini on an Intranet, they are very religious about NOT phoning home to Google under any circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</summary>

      <title>Can Your Programming Language Do This?</title>

      <summary>&lt;font face="Georgia"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, you're browsing through your code, and you notice two big blocks that look almost exactly the same. In fact, they're exactly the same, except that one block refers to "Spaghetti" and one block refers to "Chocolate Moose."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; // A trivial example: alert("I'd like some Spaghetti!"); alert("I'd like some Chocolate Moose!"); &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;These examples happen to be in JavaScript, but even if you don't know JavaScript, you should be able to follow along.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The repeated code looks wrong, of course, so you create a function:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; function SwedishChef( food ) { alert("I'd like some " + food + "!"); } SwedishChef("Spaghetti"); SwedishChef("Chocolate Moose"); &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;img title="Bork Bork Bork" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 6px; MARGIN-LEFT: 6px" alt="A picture of the Swedish Chef" src="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/01BorkBorkBork.PNG" align="right" /&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK, it's a trivial example, but you can imagine a more substantial example. This is better code for many reasons, all of which you've heard a million times. Maintainability, Readability, Abstraction = Good!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now you notice two other blocks of code which look almost the same, except that one of them keeps calling this function called BoomBoom and the other one keeps calling this function called PutInPot. Other than that, the code is pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br clear="all" /&gt; &lt;pre&gt; alert("get the lobster"); PutInPot("lobster"); PutInPot("water"); alert("get the chicken"); BoomBoom("chicken"); BoomBoom("coconut"); &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now you need a way to pass an argument to the function which itself is a function. This is an important capability, because it increases the chances that you'll be able to find common code that can be stashed away in a function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; function Cook( i1, i2, f ) { alert("get the " + i1); f(i1); f(i2); } Cook( "lobster", "water", PutInPot ); Cook( "chicken", "coconut", BoomBoom ); &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look! We're passing in a function as an argument. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can your language do this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wait... suppose you haven't already defined the functions PutInPot or BoomBoom. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just write them inline instead of declaring them elsewhere?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; Cook( "lobster", "water", function(x) { alert("pot " + x); } ); Cook( "chicken", "coconut", function(x) { alert("boom " + x); } ); &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jeez, that is handy. Notice that I'm creating a function there on the fly, not even bothering to name it, just picking it up by its ears and tossing it into a function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As soon as you start thinking in terms of anonymous functions as arguments, you might notice code all over the place that, say, does something to every element of an array.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; var a = [1,2,3]; for (i=0; i&amp;lt;a.length; i++) { a[i] = a[i] * 2; } for (i=0; i&amp;lt;a.length; i++) { alert(a[i]); } &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doing something to every element of an array is pretty common, and you can write a function that does it for you:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; function map(fn, a) { for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; a.length; i++) { a[i] = fn(a[i]); } } &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now you can rewrite the code above as:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; map( function(x){return x*2;}, a ); map( alert, a ); &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another common thing with arrays is to combine all the values of the array in some way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; function sum(a) { var s = 0; for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; a.length; i++) s += a[i]; return s; } function join(a) { var s = ""; for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; a.length; i++) s += a[i]; return s; } alert(sum([1,2,3])); alert(join(["a","b","c"])); &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sum&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;join&lt;/strong&gt; look so similar, you might want to abstract out their essence into a generic function that combines elements of an array into a single value:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; function reduce(fn, a, init) { var s = init; for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; a.length; i++) s = fn( s, a[i] ); return s; } function sum(a) { return reduce( function(a, b){ return a + b; }, a, 0 ); } function join(a) { return reduce( function(a, b){ return a + b; }, a, "" ); } &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many older languages simply had no way to do this kind of stuff. Other languages let you do it, but it's hard (for example, C has function pointers, but you have to declare and define the function somewhere else). Object-oriented programming languages aren't completely convinced that you should be allowed to do anything with functions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Java required you to create a whole object with a single method called a functor if you wanted to treat a function like a first class object. Combine that with the fact that many OO languages want you to create a whole file for each class, and it gets really klunky fast. If your programming language requires you to use functors, you're not getting all the benefits of a modern programming environment. See if you can get some of your money back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How much benefit do you really get out of writting itty bitty functions that do nothing more than iterate through an array doing something to each element?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, let's go back to that &lt;strong&gt;map&lt;/strong&gt; function. When you need to do something to every element in an array in turn, the truth is, it probably doesn't matter what order you do them in. You can run through the array forward or backwards and get the same result, right? In fact, if you have two CPUs handy, maybe you could write some code to have each CPU do half of the elements, and suddenly &lt;strong&gt;map&lt;/strong&gt; is twice as fast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or maybe, just hypothetically, you have hundreds of thousands of servers in several data centers around the world, and you have a really big array, containing, let's say, again, just hypothetically, the entire contents of the internet. Now you can run &lt;strong&gt;map&lt;/strong&gt; on thousands of computers, each of which will attack a tiny part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So now, for example, writing some really fast code to search the entire contents of the internet is as simple as calling the &lt;strong&gt;map&lt;/strong&gt; function with a basic string searcher as an argument. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The really interesting thing I want you to notice, here, is that as soon as you think of &lt;strong&gt;map&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;reduce&lt;/strong&gt; as functions that everybody can use, and they use them, you only have to get one supergenius to write the hard code to run &lt;strong&gt;map&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;reduce&lt;/strong&gt; on a global massively parallel array of computers, and all the old code that used to work fine when you just ran a loop still works only it's a zillion times faster which means it can be used to tackle huge problems in an instant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lemme repeat that. By abstracting away the very concept of looping, you can implement looping any way you want, including implementing it in a way that scales nicely with extra hardware. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now you understand something I wrote a while ago where I &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html"&gt;complained about CS students who are never taught anything but Java&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without understanding functional programming, you can't invent &lt;a href="http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html"&gt;MapReduce&lt;/a&gt;, the algorithm that makes Google so massively scalable. The terms Map and Reduce come from Lisp and functional programming. MapReduce is, in retrospect, obvious to anyone who remembers from their 6.001-equivalent programming class that purely functional programs have no side effects and are thus trivially parallelizable. The very fact that Google invented MapReduce, and Microsoft didn't, says something about why Microsoft is still playing catch up trying to get basic search features to work, while Google has moved on to the next problem: building Skynet^H^H^H^H^H^H the world's largest massively parallel supercomputer. I don't think Microsoft completely understands just how far behind they are on that wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ok. I hope you're convinced, by now, that programming languages with first-class functions let you find more opportunities for abstraction, which means your code is smaller, tighter, more reusable, and more scalable. Lots of Google applications use MapReduce and they all benefit whenever someone optimizes it or fixes bugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now I'm going to get a little bit mushy, and argue that the most productive programming environments are the ones that let you work at &lt;em&gt;different levels of abstraction&lt;/em&gt;. Crappy old FORTRAN really didn't even let you write functions. C had function pointers, but they were ugleeeeee and not anonymous and had to be implemented somewhere else than where you were using them. Java made you use functors, which is even uglier. As Steve Yegge points out, Java is the &lt;a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html"&gt;Kingdom of Nouns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;Correction: The last time I used FORTRAN was 27 years ago. Apparently it got functions. I must have been thinking about GW-BASIC.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</summary>

      <title>High-priority media apps</title>
      <link>http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/08/08.html#a1502</link>
      <summary>For most people, most of the time, a faster computer won't make much of a difference. There's nothing CPU-intensive about reading and writing email, surfing the web, or using most other applications. The notable exception to the rule, of course, is audio and video processing. Nowadays I often find myself staring impatiently at progress meters in Audacity, Audition, Camtasia Studio, and iMovie while I filter and compress large media files. No matter how fast your computer, in these situations you need it faster. &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;</summary>2006-08-08T11:02:58-05:00</entry>

      <title>Making sense of our networked lives</title>
      <link>http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/08/07.html#a1501</link>
      <summary>Two years ago, when I &lt;a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2004/08/03/primetime.html"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; my yearlong series of &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/judell/primetimehypermedia+oreillynet"&gt;Prime-Time Hypermedia&lt;/a&gt; columns on the O'Reilly Network, the term &lt;i&gt;screencast&lt;/i&gt; had yet to be coined. It wasn't until November of 2004 that Joseph McDonald and Deeje Cooley would separately &lt;a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/17.html#a1116"&gt;propose&lt;/a&gt; the term that I picked. A year later I found &lt;a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/11/18.html#a1341"&gt;325,000&lt;/a&gt; references to the term in Google's index. Today, there are 7 million. Screencasts are being used by &lt;a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/screencasts"&gt;open source projects&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/showforum.aspx?forumid=38"&gt;commercial vendors&lt;/a&gt;, and happily, as of last week, by &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/07/31/31FEajax_1.html"&gt;InfoWorld reviewers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;</summary>2006-08-07T14:50:42-05:00</entry>

      <title>Sony Releases 50GB Dual Layer Blu-ray Discs</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sonybluray.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/sonybluray.jpg" width="246" height="244" class="left"/&gt;It's been an industry non-secret that manufacturers have had an easier time making dual-layer HD DVD discs than dual layer Blu-ray discs. Hence, 30GB dual-layer HD DVD media have already been on the market, beating the single layer 25GB Blu-ray discs by five whole gigabytes. But now Blu-ray has the last laugh as Sony finally gets the 50GB dual-layer Blu-ray discs onto hands of US consumers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 50GB discs can hold four hours of HD content, and transfers at 24Mbps. They've got a built in scratch guard and "archival reliability" to prevent bad burns. Which, at $48 a disc, would be the most expensive coaster you've ever made. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Jason Chen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.sel.sony.com/en/press_room/b2b/media_app_systems/release/24099.html"&gt;Press Release&lt;/a&gt; [Sony via &lt;a href="http://news.sel.sony.com/en/press_room/b2b/media_app_systems/release/24099.html"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=9moxvE"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=9moxvE" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

So for people who live in and around Mountain View, you can go ahead and stop leeching off your neighbor's WiFi and start leeching off Google's. Heck, maybe I'll make the drive over there to Mountain View and try it out myself. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Jason Chen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/business/technology/15284792.htm"&gt;Google launches free WiFi in Mountain View&lt;/a&gt; [San Jose Mercury News]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=CMMs1q"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=CMMs1q" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Microsoft Designing Supplemental Xbox 360 Controller For FPS Games?</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="360contr.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/360contr.jpg" width="250" height="136" class="left"/&gt;At the Seattle Gamefest, Microsoft Hardware manager Robert S. Walker said they were looking at modifying "the right analog stick on the controller to make it more conducive to the precise movements used in shooters and various other genres." This is great news, since it's really a bitch to aim with any kind of precision using an analog stick instead of a mouse. Plus, Microsoft says they've got no plans at all to bring a mouse and keyboard to their console.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This new controller won't replace your two-stick, one-d-pad affair, but will be used as a supplmental controller for FPS games or games where you need more precise control. Think of it as how a driving wheel would be useful in PGR, but would get you owned by zombies in Dead Rising. In our opinion, they should just break down and make a keyboard and mouse controller for the 360, then charge $99 for it and make a killing. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Jason Chen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/43366"&gt;Late Night Consoling&lt;/a&gt; [Shacknews via &lt;a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/keyboard/fps-controller-coming-to-the-xbox-360-194278.php"&gt;Kotaku&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=U89zer"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=U89zer" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Who Else Besides Dell Used The Sony Batteries? Apple?</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="applelogo2.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/applelogo2.jpg" width="150" height="150" class="left"/&gt;Remember the &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/battery/dell-recalls-41-million-batteries-stops-big-bada-booms-194190.php"&gt;4.1 million Dell battery recall&lt;/a&gt;? Well, these faulty batteries were made by Sony, meaning that Dell most likely was not the only laptop maker with unsafe batteries. Specifically, Apple, who had a similar battery exchange program for MacBook Pros sold from February to May of this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Channel News Asia says a spokeswoman from Apple said they were "looking into the issue", meaning that the trade-in program has a chance of being expanded to encompass more than just four months' worth of batteries. If anything develops with Apple or any other laptop vendor like Sony or HP, we'll let you know. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Jason Chen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/corporatenews/view/224917/1/.html"&gt;Dell to recall 4.1 million notebook PC batteries&lt;/a&gt; [Channel News Asia via &lt;a href="http://www.macfixit.com/article.php?story=20060814183025383"&gt;MacFixIt&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/archives/2006/08/16/has_apple_shipped_the_same_batteries_as_dell.html"&gt;Guardian Blog&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=LrFZzP"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=LrFZzP" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Confirmed: Microsoft Zune Has Video</title>

The Zune Insider blog says that the video &lt;i&gt;The Kill&lt;/i&gt; from the band 30 Seconds To Mars is going to be pre-loaded onto the Zune. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the first generation of the Zune has that gigantic screen, which has been confirmed by insiders, it makes sense for it to support video.

      <title>Xbox 360 Camera To Come With Free Game</title>

Gamasutra says the Xbox 360 Camera is going to ship with &lt;i&gt;TotemBall&lt;/i&gt;, which is a game developed by UK-based Strange Flavour and Freeverse. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You control the game almost solely using your arms, moving the totem pole around the level and collect items within a certain time limit.

Maybe they'll add functionality to jet fighter games where you can control the plane by whirling around your living room with your arms outstretched. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Jason Chen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=10494"&gt;GameFest: Xbox 360 Camera To Ship With Free Game&lt;/a&gt; [Gamasutra via &lt;a href="http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/totemball/360-cam-to-ship-with-free-game-194587.php"&gt;Kotaku&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=KqYT2S"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=KqYT2S" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>DirecTV HR20-700 HD DVR: First Review, In the Wild</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/01-hr20.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="01-hr20.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/01-hr20-thumb.jpg" width="500" height="333" class="center"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Best Buy prematurely(?) sold Earl Bonovich&amp;mdash;if that is his real name&amp;mdash;one of DirecTV's new HR20-700 high definition digital video recorders. The near-rabid fanboy wiped the foam from his mouth, and posted an exhaustive (exhausting?) review on DVStalk.com. Unlike the first high definition DirecTV DVR, this one isn't powered by TiVo. That makes us sad. But the HDMI-ready, 250Gig box does have some nice features, like the ability to scan 8 sports channels on one screen (something they like to call Sports Mix). If you're ready to plunk down your credit card, beware&amp;mdash; some rather basic functions have been turned off by DirecTV. A video of, picture of the DVR's back panel, and more, after the jump. (And thank you, Earl, Duke of DirecTV DVRs)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's that ass shot from Earl's Review:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/08-backpanel.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="08-backpanel.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/08-backpanel-thumb.jpg" width="500" height="333" class="center"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;High Definition TV Output (via HDMI and Component)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;2 Sets of RCA (Red/White/Yellow Outputs) - 1 S-Video&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;1 Optical Digital Output&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;Dual SAT Tuners&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;Dual ATSC Tuners (functionality is disabled at this time, see notes later in the review)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;Wired RJ-45 Ethernet Port&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;External SATA Connection&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;300gb SATA Internal Hard Drive&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;RF Remote Compatible with the Included RC24, and the soon to be released RC32RF&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And here's that video of Sports Mix:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;object width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ohpUIYXiYFU"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ohpUIYXiYFU" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Estimated Recording Space (Not a cumulative value)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;30 Hours of MPEG-2 (OTA) HD&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;50 Hours of MPEG-4 HD&lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull;200 Hours of Standard Definition (SD)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The set does 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i, but no resolution of 1080p is supported. Fine, I guess. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earl notes that the ATSC over the air HD tuners are in the box, but they've been disabled by DirecTV. That means many people won't be able to watch local HD channels. Boo! They do plan to enable them, but we'll wait til we see it live before we give them the golf clap.&lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Brian Lam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dbstalk.com/showthread.php?t=61862"&gt;DirecTV HR20-700 High Definition DVR&lt;/a&gt; [DBStalk.com]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://directv.com/DTVAPP/global/contentPage.jsp?assetId=900025"&gt;DirecTV HR20-700 High Definition DVR&lt;/a&gt; [DirecTV]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=GwrfAP"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=GwrfAP" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

It's enough to make an HTC fan both wet his pants and drool on himself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For non-fanboys, the HTC TyTN just launched in Europe and has a 2-megapixel camera, 128MB of on-board storage, 802.11g WiFi, and EDGE/Quad-band GSM.

No, there isn't a new gadget to magically make all delicious foods sugar free, but there is a new cellphone out that can manage your diabetes easily and conveniently. This phone, from the folks at HealthPia, is essentially a cellphone and glucometer. It will measure blood sugar levels, record and send results to yourself and others and even manage your meal plans. The system uses custom software along with an LG UX5000, VX5200, or LX350 and a Glucopack. My pops is a diabetic, now while he isn't technologically savvy, I would still feel better knowing he could monitor his blood sugar level anywhere he goes. Good job, HealthPia. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Travis Hudson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.healthpia.us/products.asp"&gt;Product Page&lt;/a&gt; [HealthPia]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=ssDqzk"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=ssDqzk" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

Complete all of the information digitally on your smartphone and an automatic dispenser will shoot out your keys. Only one hotel in Redmond, Washington is currently testing the system. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Travis Hudson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=" http://www.mobilemag.com/content/100/313/C9126/"&gt;Mariott testing smartphone-based hotel check-ins&lt;/a&gt; [MobileMag]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=y6PJ1E"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=y6PJ1E" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

True, it's got 1280x1024 resolution, WiFi and Ethernet connectivity, Windows/Mac/Linux support, USB hard drive support, and a 24-bit color TFT, but you could easily buy a cheap 19-inch Dell LCD and an even cheaper Dell desktop and achieve the same effect, while saving you a couple hundred bones. However, you'll lose the effect of it actually being a mounted photo frame, and not a computer.

      <title>Dealzmodo: 2GB SD Card, USB Card Reader, $38</title>

With damn near every gadget out there using SD for expandable memory, this might be the perfect spare card to add to your collection. I haven't really heard much about PQI, but an SD card is an SD card, right? For comparison purposes, most other 2GB SD cards retail for double what this costs. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Travis Hudson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://meritline.stores.yahoo.net/pqi-2gb-60x-sd-card.html"&gt;PQI 2GB SD Card&lt;/a&gt; [Meritline]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=iQ3nIq"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=iQ3nIq" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>USB Geek MP3 Player: So Cheap, It's Almost Disposable</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="cheap_mp3.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/cheap_mp3.jpg" width="520" height="125" class="center"/&gt;Those of us who have kids nagging them for an iPod will be happy to see this $15 MP3 player, enough to keep those wee ones happy for hours on end. How many hours? Well, you'll get 10 hours of music playback on one AAA battery. This thing is so cheap, the SD/MMC memory card you insert inside will cost more than the player itself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looks like it's pretty easy to use too, with simple transport controls on the side. Pop the cap and it's a USB thumb drive. Although it's not the &lt;a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/mp3/9-mp3-player-174491.php"&gt;lowest-priced MP3 player we've seen&lt;/a&gt;, it's just about cheap enough to be disposable; might want to get a half-dozen, enough to give one to each of your kids (that you're aware of). &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Charlie White&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.usbgeek.com/prod_detail.php?prod_id=0528"&gt;Product Page&lt;/a&gt; [USB Geek, via &lt;a href="http://www.i4u.com/article6303.html"&gt;I4U News&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=D3uOW8"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=D3uOW8" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>GM Cuts XM Prices by 39 Percent</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Buick_XM-Radio.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/Buick_XM-Radio.jpg" width="250" height="188" class="left"/&gt;General Motors has announced a price cut for the optional XM factory-installed XM satellite radio. It is a pretty significant cut of 39-percent. Beginning with the 2007 year vehicles the factory-installed XM satellite receiver will go for $199, cut from $325. A GM suit explained the reasoning behind the cut: "XM Radio has become a must-have feature for many customers and demand continues to grow." Wait, so demand it up and the prices go down? I know I slept through a lot of my macroeconomics class, but that doesn't sound right. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A whopping 90-percent of all 2007 model year GM vehicles will offer optional factory-installed XM. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Travis Hudson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://jalopnik.com/cars/news/its-not-radio-its-xm-gm-cuts-price-of-xm-radio-to-199-194685.php"&gt;It's Not Radio, It's XM: GM Cuts Price of XM Radio To $199&lt;/a&gt; [Jalopnik]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=WFi5k5"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=WFi5k5" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>BrionVega ts522 Radio: Sexy iTalian Tuner</title>

The Italian set was masterminded by Marco Zanuso and Richard Sapper, who have designed for Mercedes Benz and IBM. (There's a combination you don't see on many resumes.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back to the radio, though. Since this set is all superficial and all, we'll start with the color: It's available in Sun Orange, Snow White, Night Black and Red. (Yes, just red.) It's powered by a "Broadband Loudspeaker", which is a fancy way of saying, a full-frequency range'd speaker. In mono. There's a headphone jack, and you'll want to note the AC power only comes in 220v flavors. You also might note the charming analog tune dials. Don't worry, the radio has 29 presets, too. More pictures of the pretty, after the jump. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Brian Lam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="00016_1_gallery_big.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/00016_1_gallery_big.jpg" width="400" height="356" class="center"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img alt="00016_2_gallery_big.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/00016_2_gallery_big.jpg" width="400" height="356" class="center"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img alt="00016_5_gallery_big.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/00016_5_gallery_big.jpg" width="400" height="356" class="center"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img alt="00016_8_gallery_big.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/00016_8_gallery_big.jpg" width="400" height="356" class="center/&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.brionvega.it/home.php?lang=eng&amp;pag=9.1&amp;code=00016"&gt;ts522 Radio&lt;/a&gt; [Brionvega]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=jxjUBT"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=jxjUBT" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

(Well, one EDGE card at least.) The Plug-and-play Falcom Samba 75 grants the user access to the sweet speeds of the EDGE variety, along with GSM and GPRS support. Even better, there's a SIM slot right on the module, so if you're one of those people who own dozens of cellphones (to keep all of your girlfriends in line, naturally), a simple SIM transfer will have you up and running before the wife finds out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also featured in the hands-on is the Falcom Samba, which supports GSM and GPRS, but not EDGE. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both cards, of which Dave has plenty of pictures of, are available now. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Nicholas Deleon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;A HREF="http://mobilitytoday.com/news/006816/Falcom_USB_EDGE"&gt;EXCLUSIVE: Falcom USB Edge cards for ultraportables&lt;/A&gt; [Mobility Today]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;A HREF="http://www.falcomusa.com/"&gt;Falcom Home Page&lt;/A&gt; [Falcom]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=4Xs5r0"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=4Xs5r0" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Laptops to be Banned from US Airlines?</title>

Even if they didn't read &lt;a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/safety/batteries-on-a-plane-339-burning-batteries-since-2003-194020.php"&gt;our post&lt;/a&gt; about exploding batteries possibly bringing down a plane or two, they're now about to overreact again, considering banning laptops from all airline flights.&lt;blockquote&gt;The use of laptop computers on airliners may be banned entirely because of a series of incidents involving overheated batteries, including a May 15 incident in which a laptop caught fire in an overhead luggage compartment as a Lufthansa airliner prepared to leave Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, The Wall Street Journal reported.&lt;/blockquote&gt;As one of our astute commenters so accurately pointed out, there's only a one in 4.2 million chance of a laptop even so much as smoldering on a plane on any given day. That puts the danger level of flying with laptops right up there with being killed by a bee sting. Of course, we all must have complete and total safety at all costs, so that's too big of a chance to take. Ban the laptops! iPods, too, while you're at it! Morons. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Charlie White&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/dell/exploding-laptops-worry-air-regulators-194225.php"&gt;Exploding Laptops Worry Air Regulators&lt;/a&gt; [The Consumerist]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=J23Vnt"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=J23Vnt" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>LG K320, Slim as a Supermodel, Hits Europe</title>
      <summary>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; targetTerm194656 = 'LG K320'; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lgk320.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/lgk320.jpg" width="400" height="235" class="center border"/&gt;Unlike what we &lt;A HREF="xxx"&gt;thought&lt;/A&gt; back in May, the LG K320, noted for its super slim body, is not only going to be available in Europe, but it may be there &lt;i&gt;right now&lt;/i&gt;. Importantly, the specs haven't changed: it's still only about 0.4-inches thick, plays MP3s about as well as cellphones can right now, and sports 128MB of built-in memory and Bluetooth. Thankfully, it doesn't appear to have any of those utterly &lt;A HREF="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/chocolate/why-the-chocolate-phone-stinks-on-ice-193589.php"&gt;useless&lt;/A&gt; touch-sensitive buttons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hollywood-thin Korean cellphones don't come cheaply as you might expect, with the K320 selling for the equivalent of $417 in crazy Euroland currency. It should make its debut by mid-August, or right around now. Let's pester LG to make them release it stateside. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Nicholas Deleon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;A HREF="http://www.infosyncworld.com/news/n/6970.html"&gt;Slim LG KG320 candybar now shipping&lt;/A&gt; [InfoSync]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=JfHNdb"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=JfHNdb" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Runco Rules the High-End Projector Stratosphere</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="runco_1080p.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/runco_1080p.jpg" width="520" height="327" class="center"/&gt;If you're looking for the highest-end home theater DLP projectors, Runco is where you go, and the company has now introduced seven 1080p (1920x1080) projectors that will debut next month at CEDIA Expo 2006 (Custom Electronic Design and Installation Association). The RS-1100 (pictured here) features Runco's CineWide with AutoScope technology. It has Runco's proprietary SuperOnyx light engine and a selectable lamp intensity control. You can also choose from six different lenses to fit your home theater dimensions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the home theater stratosphere, folks, where the lowest-priced projector starts at $11,995, and for a three-chip video Xtreme machine with all the options you'll spend $115,000. But if you're looking for a home theater whose projection quality is as good or better than most commercial cinemas, look no further. There's a lot of special technology at work here&amp;mdash;just check out the press release after the jump for more acronym-infested trademarks than you'll see in a long, long time. The projectors will be available in October. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Charlie White&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.runco.com/projectors.html "&gt;Projectors&lt;/a&gt; [Runco]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RUNCO LAUNCHES BROADEST LINE OF 1080p PROJECTORS IN THE HOME THEATER MARKET&lt;br /&gt; Seven New High Performance 1080p Models to Debut at CEDIA EXPO 2006.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Union City, CA - August 16, 2006 - Solidifying its leading position in the high-end home theater market, at CEDIA EXPO 2006, Runco International will launch their highly anticipated line of single-chip and 3-chip state-of-the-art 1080p native resolution (1920 x 1080) DLP™ projectors and will showcase the exclusive demo of a 3-chip 1080p projector with CineWide™ technology in the Runco theater on the show floor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A total of seven new 1080p projectors are being launched, rounding out the broadest projector line in the home theater market. Each new model is offered with Runco's exclusive CineWide and/or CineWide with AutoScope™ technology as an available option. Retail pricing ranges from just $11,995.00 for the single-chip DLP Reflection™ Series model to $115,000.00 for the most sophisticated 3-chip DLP Video Xtreme™ machine when equipped with the CineWide with AutoScope option and Runco's most advanced McKinley anamorphic optics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Company President Bob Hana outlined Runco's strategy for providing dealers a complete spectrum of 1080p product choices, "Our goal is to offer our dealers 1080p solutions across the board in terms of price points, product features and performance, and the ability to spec the right product for every installation challenge they encounter. With our new 1080p portfolio, we are providing the product assortment they need to retain their competitive advantage."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Each of these 1080p products has been engineered to Runco's exacting standards for the highest levels of video performance, and include Runco's industry leading Vivix™ video processing. The result is stunning 1080p imagery that can take full advantage of the emerging HD DVD and Blu Ray high definition DVD technologies coming to market. In addition, Runco's careful attention to scaling algorithms results in the finest reproduction of standard NTSC source material without picture degradation," Hana added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Runco's new 1080p model lineup begins with two models in the Reflection Series, the RS-1100 and RS-1100 Ultra, both incorporating single-chip DLP based light engines engineered and calibrated for the finest video reproduction and certified to comply with the Imaging Science Foundation™ (ISF) exacting standards for excellence in picture quality. The RS-1100 and RS-1100 Ultra feature Runco's proprietary SuperOnyx™ light engine and Selectable Lamp Intensity Control™ (SLIC™) which provides two selectable lamp intensity levels to allow maximum flexibility for screen size, ambient light conditions, brightness and contrast balance, and preservation of usable lamp life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The RS-1100 Ultra offers six CinOptx™ Proteus and Telesto premium grade lens options with a range of different throw distances. Features such as O-Path™ light path enhancement technology and AxiShift™ technology with a motorized horizontal and vertical lens shift system help resolve even the most challenging projector placement issues. Both of these products will set the standard for single chip 1080p DLP performance, representing the pinnacle in their product category.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Runco's no-compromise Video Xtreme portfolio is now expanded with the addition of five 1080p models. Designed and engineered with proprietary technologies, the Video Xtreme Series will include two new single-chip 1080p DLP projectors and three new 3-chip 1080p DLP projectors. All Video Xtreme projectors are paired with a new version of Runco's acclaimed DHD controller, the DHD-2 which is engineered for optimal 1080p performance with the new projectors. The VX-55d, the flagship of the Video Xtreme line will demonstrate its performance, features, and screen-filling power in the Runco Theater on the show floor, booth number 141.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of these new Runco 1080p models will be on display in Runco's dealer presentation and training room #501 in the Denver Convention Center. In addition, select products will be demonstrated in the Runco theater at booth #141. Every new model in the fall lineup will be available by October, with some models already shipping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please log on to &lt;a href="http://www.castercomm.com"&gt;www.castercomm.com&lt;/a&gt; for up to the minute CEDIA news from Runco. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information on Runco International, Inc., please visit &lt;a href="http://www.runco.com"&gt;www.runco.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=gOwne6"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=gOwne6" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>AVerVision 150 USB Document Camera from AverMedia</title>
      <summary>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; targetTerm194634 = 'Avervision 150'; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="avervision150.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/avervision150.jpg" width="200" height="333" class="right"/&gt;For the teachers and other professionals in the audience who use overhead projectors regularly, the AVerVision 150 Portable Document Camera could save you some much needed time. Or not. Equipped with a three-megapixel camera, the AVerVision 150 takes pictures of documents&amp;mdash;homework assignments, quarterly reports, arrest warrants, etc.&amp;mdash;for later VGA display. There's enough memory to hold 35 JPEGs, though the actual amount of memory on this puppy isn't specified. If you so desire, you can offload pictures to a PC or Mac via a USB cable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The camera also doubles as a Web cam, capturing video at 24 frames-per-second. It makes use of Averzoom technology, which allows users to zoom in and out without having to continually pan around to re-center the image.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AVerVision 150 is available now and retails for $599.99, which seems awfully high for what amounts to a specialized digital camera. What's born every minute? &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Nicholas Deleon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;A HREF="http://www.avermedia-usa.com/media/081506.html"&gt;Press Release&lt;/A&gt; [AVerMedia via &lt;A HREF="http://www.everythingusb.com/avermedia_avervision_150.html"&gt;Everything USB&lt;/A&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=LwafnX"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=LwafnX" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Progressive Wake Alarm Clock</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="70460.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/70460.jpg" width="180" height="180" class="left"/&gt;I didn't think it was possible, but this alarm clock is pretty badass. Yes, as of today alarms can now officially be badass. Rather than jolting yourself out of deep R.E.M. sleep with an annoying buzz, this alarm clock uses a 30-minute long process to gently awake the individual by tantalizing the senses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At 30 minutes from the desired alarm time the wake process will begin with the lights glowing softly. Tthe clock will then begin to slowly heat aromatherapy beads releasing a scent and 15 minutes before wake time the alarm clock will begin playing nature noises. All of these different methods get louder/brighter/more intense as it gets closer to the wake time. It even looks pretty cool. The Progression Wake Up Clock is available for $50 and would be excellent for the morning grump&amp;mdash;like myself. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Travis Hudson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hammacher.com/publish/70460.asp?promo=homepage&amp;cm_ven=CJ&amp;cm_pla=1781363&amp;cm_ite=Hammacher+Schlemmer&amp;cm_cat=1511450"&gt;Product Page&lt;/a&gt; [Via &lt;a href="http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20060815/progression-wake-up-clock/"&gt;Coolest-Gadget&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=DjxgZp"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=DjxgZp" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

Put through its paces, the Sierra performed admirably, though there's very little room for any other items, be they magazines or other lifestyle &lt;A HREF="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/gadgets/vibrating-condom--rub-some-of-the-powder-on-my-lips-bill-128507.php"&gt;accessories&lt;/A&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Should you be in the market for a bag designed to hold your expensive camera and expensive laptop (and who isn't these days?), Naneu's pretty much got you covered.

Even elementary school kids need to start learning about the different countries in the Middle East&amp;mdash;the knowledge will come in handy. This SmartGlobe from Oregon Scientific is an educational toy that can teach kiddos about the world with fun games and quizzes. It has modes for all ages and the ability to compete against other &lt;s&gt;future soldiers&lt;/s&gt; players or against the computer.

      <title>Bluevoice, the Combination Watch and Bluetooth Headset</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bluevoiceear.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/bluevoiceear.jpg" width="400" height="331" class="center border"/&gt;Two devices that never really needed to be combined have been with the Bluevoice, a combination Bluetooth headset and watch. Due to be released in November (but heavy promotion begins in 2007), the Bluevoice solves the problem of "feel[ing] like a cyborg with a [B]luetooth headset in your ear all day." Yeah, now you just look like a total dork. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Bluevoice is normally worn as a wristwatch, but it can be unclipped and held to an ear when you receive a phone call. Both an analog and digital clock version will be released, with the fancy-pants analog costing $127.95 and the everyman digital coming in at $119.95. Any ideas that you may have about it being easier, perhaps, to just wear a normal wristwatch and answer the phone are entirely unwarranted: this is the future and you'll grow to love it. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Nicholas Deleon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;A HREF="http://www.bluetoothwatches.com/"&gt;Product Page&lt;/A&gt; [Bluetooth Watches via &lt;A HREF="http://www.techdigest.tv/2006/08/bluevoice_combi.html"&gt;Tech Digest&lt;/A&gt;]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=tjVfV7"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=tjVfV7" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Maingear Prisma Entertainment PC: Just Another Pretty Face</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="maingear_prysma.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/maingear_prysma.jpg" width="520" height="271" class="center"/&gt;Add mystical pyramid power to your home theater with the Maingear Prisma Entertainment PC, a uniquely-shaped Viiv media center with unremarkable innards. Built on an ATX motherboard, you can goose it up with a dual-core Intel 3.2GHz Pentium D 940 processor, and you can opt to install two standard-definition TV tuners and an HDTV tuner as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this high style comes at a price, though, where even the stripped-down version sells for $1958. Available in lots of snazzy colors including black, silver, green, red, white and yellow, a respectably-equipped version will cost you upwards of $3400. It's nice looking; Maingear is literally thinking outside the box, but PC Magazine's opinion of the Maingear Prisma? Eh. 2.5 out of five. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Charlie White&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.maingear.com/ProductCart/pc/configurePrd.asp?idproduct=527"&gt;Product Page&lt;/a&gt; [Maingear]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1984942,00.asp"&gt;Maingear Prysma Review&lt;/a&gt; [PC Magazine] &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=vVjp2b"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=vVjp2b" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>EleeNo Bingo Watch: Tells You the Approximate Time</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bingo_watch.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/bingo_watch.jpg" width="481" height="359" class="center"/&gt;The EleeNo Bingo Watch has a series of tiny round windows laid out in a grid similar to a bingo game, where the outer dots show you the hours and the inner ones display the minutes. The only problem with that? There are just four minute indicators, forcing you to tell time in 15-minute increments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Bingo Watch could be a great conversation starter, and it might be perfect for you if you don't really care what time it is. So what time is it, someone asks? You might as well just answer that it's two hairs past a freckle, Eastern Elbow Time.

      <title>The Ice Cellphone from O2: Cool as Ice?</title>
      <summary>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; targetTerm194584 = 'O2 Ice'; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="o2ice.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/o2ice.jpg" width="300" height="450" class="center"/&gt;European cellphone carrier O2 just announced the Ice, an all-white cellphone that's sure to make the same sort of splash that &lt;A HREF="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/chocolate/why-the-chocolate-phone-stinks-on-ice-193589.php"&gt;other&lt;/A&gt; oddly-named cellphones have made here. This 3G candybar comes with Bluetooth support, an MP3 player and a 1.3-megapixel camera. Ice is supposed to excel at video calling, but never having seen it action, I'll withhold my opinion. It also uses O2's Active service, so you can look forward to being inundated with news and infotainment 24/7. What, Michael Owen injured again? Hang up the boots, kid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Look for the Ice in September in the UK for around $190 on pre-paid plans. Who knows if we'll see any Ice in the U.S. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Nicholas Deleon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;A HREF="http://www.gadgetcandy.com/archives/2006/08/post_470.php"&gt;Unveiled: O2 Ice!&lt;/A&gt; [Gadget Candy]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=c3uKxr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=c3uKxr" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

If that's not quite fancy enough for you, get yours with a silver or gold fiber brim. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rest of the hat is made of microsuede in your choice of colors, giving you an interesting blend of metallic and smooth textures. The carbon fiber cap is €115 ($146), and a silver or gold-brimmed hat is a relative bargain at €99 ($126). &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Charlie White&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ginity.com/"&gt;Product Page&lt;/a&gt; [Ginity Trading Corporation]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=P6Uj71"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=P6Uj71" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Philips 42PF9831D/37 TV: Hands All Over the 42-inch LCD with Ambilight PLUS Giggling</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/IKZ6atTmQEA"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/IKZ6atTmQEA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="600" height="350"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;I just got my hands on a 42-inch Ambilight LCD TV from Philips. Ambilight, if you didn't know, is a system that shines light out of the sides of a TV set. The resulting halo reduces eyestrain, and makes the set feel like it's bigger than it really is. In a dark room, the effect is dramatic. This is a new model, with a border around the edges to reflect the light show without the need for a white wall. There are modes like Movie, Ambiance, Color, and Action: Action provides the quickest response, and Color mode locks the light down to one hue. The brightness is adjustable manually, or automatically by a light sensor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's a video of my friend Alyssa trying to introduce the set to you all without giggling. Mission? Unsuccessful. The video is little more than a blooper roll, but on a slowish news day, I thought you'd enjoy. We would have shot more, but we figured it was time better spent just watching the TV. Jump for a photo, and more impressions of this beautiful TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without running any benchmarks, I'll say I'm impressed by it. In a nutshell, the TV has a 1366x768 pixel display, is CableCard ready, and the picture has pretty decent black-levels for an LCD&amp;mdash;so much that I actually did a double take; I initially thought I was using a plasma. (I'm sure that comparison wouldn't stand up to a hardcore test comparison with a high-end Pioneer Plasma, but take my initial mistake as a good thing.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I could be wrong, but I believe the 4500:1 dynamic contrast ratio is due to the set's ability to selectively turn off or dim sections of the backlighting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing I've yet to test: according to the spec sheet, the LCD only supports 1024x768 pixels when connected to a computer. That's somewhat disappointing, given that it's less than what the set should be capable of. And while there are dual HDMI inputs, there aren't any dedicated VGA or DVI inputs. Oh, one more nice perk is the built-in card reader, which can read images and MP3s and play them back on the set. No video support, however, from memory cards. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Brian Lam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.consumer.philips.com/consumer/catalog/tree/TV_GR_US_CONSUMER/FLAT_TV_CA_US_CONSUMER/LCD_EXTRA_LARGE_GT40_SU_US_CONSUMER/product/42PF9831D_37_US_CONSUMER/catalog.jsp?activeTab=specifications&amp;language=en&amp;country=US&amp;catalogType=CONSUMER&amp;proxybuster=OZL5FI42UQO21J0RMRCSHQFHKFSESI5P"&gt;Philips 42PF9831D/37 TV&lt;/a&gt; [Philips]&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=uS1V6V"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=uS1V6V" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>myKeyO Keyboard Organizer: Updated Unit is Backlit, Wireless</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="keyboard_organizer.jpg" src="http://gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/keyboard_organizer.jpg" width="520" height="286" class="center"/&gt;Here's an updated version of the old Owltech keyboard organizer &lt;a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/peripherals/owltech-owlkb109pbx-keyboard-with-organizer-underneath-026904.php"&gt;we saw here long ago&lt;/a&gt;, and this one's the backlit myKeyO Palmrest Multimedia Keyboard Organizer, available in your choice of wired or wireless models. Its claim to fame is its ability to stash lots of stuff in its base, which the company says only increases the thickness of the keyboard by a tenth of an inch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to its improved design with its backlighting, scroll wheel and volume wheel, the added palm rest area gives you more storage inside, too. The company will soon begin taking orders for Fall delivery, with the USB corded unit selling for $34.95. The wireless model, which also includes an optical rechargeable mouse, will be $49.95. The words "wireless" and "backlit" don't seem to go together well (think worn-out batteries after a week or so), but we'll see. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Charlie White&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.keyboardorganizer.com/product.htm"&gt;Product Page&lt;/a&gt; [myKeyO]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=QWi6gs"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=QWi6gs" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

The S330 also has support for GPS and DMB TV broadcasts, something people in Korea have been enjoying for a little while now but us here can only read about. Available in 20GB and 30GB sizes, the S330 also throws in a bunch of time-wasting games. Odds of it reaching North America? Quick, let me get my Magic 8 Ball, since that's probably the best indication we'll get.

      <title>Microsoft TouchLight: Touch Screen Technology with a Twist</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/F1br3fDZyUQ"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/F1br3fDZyUQ" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Researchers over at Microsoft have developed TouchLight, a touch screen technology that combines off-the-shelf components to create a unique and interactive affair. Several different types of cameras are positioned behind a holographic projection material screen recording your movement. Approaching the screen, you then see a projection of yourself or whatever you have touching the screen. This opens up several different types of applications, not least of which is the normal touch screen activities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is really one of those stories where seeing is believing, so be sure check out the fruits of Redomnd's research and start thinking about ways to abuse it like we do with a Xerox machine. &lt;span class="byline"&gt;&amp;ndash; Nicholas Deleon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;A HREF="http://www.slashgear.com/microsoft-touchlight-3d-technology-16944.php"&gt;Microsoft's TouchLight 3D Technology&lt;/A&gt; [SlashGear]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?a=G6vC00"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.gawker.com/~a/gizmodo/full?i=G6vC00" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Carbon Credit Markets</title>
      <link>http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/08/13/carbon_credit_markets.html</link>
      <author/>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Today I heard a presentation by Michael Molitor from &lt;a href="http://www.climatewedge.com/"&gt;Climate Wedge&lt;/a&gt;. He is an expert on environmental issues and his company has created a fund that buys and sells "Voluntary Carbon Units" (VCUs).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carbon credits or Carbon Units are basically a unit that represents one metric ton of CO2 emissions. The EU has a market called a Compliance market where companies can buy credits to offset their EU Allowances. For example if company X only has an allowance of 100 tons of CO2 emissions, they have the choice of either buying carbon credits on the market or lowering their emissions by that much. Emission allowances will continue to go down driving prices of credits up and/or causing companies to innovate instead of paying for these credits. It is any interesting and now exceedingly common practice that makes it easier for companies to become "carbon neutral" while providing incentives for companies to innovate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to the formal compliance market which is mostly for EU regulated companies to buy and sell their credits to meet their allowances, there is a voluntary market which involves "softer" carbon credits and allows companies that are not yet regulated to play in this market. HSBC, for instance has announced that it is now "carbon neutral". It is not required by law to do this, but as people become more sensitive to the issues of global warming, carbon neutrality will have an increasing impact on customer and investor relations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a number of individual level carbon neutral initiatives. Airlines, automobile companies, oil companies are beginning to provide carbon neutral products where a portion of the cost or the payment of an addition expense go toward making the use of that product or service carbon neutral. The interesting thing is that in most cases the costs are quite small. To make your whole life carbon neutral it costs roughly 1% of your income.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think this is a great idea and the notion of being carbon neutral is very appealing. I am going to try to do this immediately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, a few things concern me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've googled around for companies and non-profits that offer carbon units and some look rather sketchy and/or expensive. There is also the issue of the quality of the carbon unit. Some little city threatening to build a coal power plant, then not doing it in exchange for carbon units seems less sincere than someone rolling out a photovoltaic power generator. "Good" carbon units like those on the Compliance Market trade at a premium because they are more closely audited and provided from reputable organizations. I think that these markets will grow quickly and hope the scam artists don't steal money from too many good intentioned people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other thing that scares me a bit is that although I like markets, I worry that a lot of money will flow to companies trying to innovate in this space. I see a VC bubble in energy technology right now too. When I see lots of money pouring into an industry like this, I worry that a bubble will form causing inefficiencies, reduction in quality of investors, noise level increases drowning out experts and other things that I saw during the dot com bubble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, this is not enough. This is all a huge step in the right directly, but we need to be doing everything we can, and even that may not be enough. It will sure feel good to be carbon neutral, but we definitely can't stop there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/08/13/carbon_credit_markets.html#comments" title="Comment"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/08/13/carbon_credit_markets.html#trackbacks" title="Trackback"&gt;TrackBack&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

      <author/>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;On Friday, &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/moblog/entries/2006/08/05/004302.html"&gt;I met John Buckman&lt;/a&gt;. He runs Magnatune, a record label that uses Creative Commons. I've been a huge fan of &lt;a href="http://www.magnatune.com/"&gt;Magnatune&lt;/a&gt; and had been looking forward to meeting him. At the meeting he told me about &lt;a href="http://bookmooch.com"&gt;BookMooch&lt;/a&gt; which just launched today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BookMooch is very cool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It reminds me a bit of &lt;a href="http://www.bookcrossing.com/"&gt;BookCrossing&lt;/a&gt;, but the approach is different. BookCrossing is a way to leave books for people in public places and allow people to find these books. You get to track your book and has a neat book-as-artifact element.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BookMooch is more systematic. On BookMooch, you register your books and others search for books. You use points to get books that you earn by listing books. Unlike many other used book services, they don't get involved in the shipping and payment. It's peer-to-peer. Of course, if the book isn't available, there is a link to Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;John is very good at combining clean sharing with business to provide a win-win for the various players. BookMooch and Magnatune both have John's sensibility. I view John as a rare example of a serial sharing economy entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/08/08/bookmooch.html#comments" title="Comment"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/08/08/bookmooch.html#trackbacks" title="Trackback"&gt;TrackBack&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

      <title>International Roaming Fees for Voicemail on GSM</title>
      <link>http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/08/07/international_roaming_fees_for_voicemail_on_gsm.html</link>
      <author/>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;I heard a horror story the other day about someone who was traveling for an extended period on a ship. His phone was from Europe. In LA, he placed one called. For a month or so, people who called his phone got voicemail. Because he was last seen by the network as being in LA, all of his voicemail calls incurred roaming charges and he ended up with a $3000 voicemail bill. He argued, but they did not refund it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I checked the T-Mobile web site and sure enough, after a bit of digging, I found this (&lt;a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/templates/faq.aspx?PAsset=Inl_Pop_FAQ#whattoexpectinbill"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;blockquote&gt;Unless you switch your device off or activate Unconditional Call Forwarding on your device, you will be billed for calls delivered to your voice mail box while you are roaming internationally.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The odd thing is, I'm quite sure he didn't have his phone on during the travel period. He said that they had told him that even without the phone on the call was still routed through LA. Does anyone else have any experience with this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/08/07/international_roaming_fees_for_voicemail_on_gsm.html#comments" title="Comment"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/08/07/international_roaming_fees_for_voicemail_on_gsm.html#trackbacks" title="Trackback"&gt;TrackBack&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

      <author/>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I blogged about how one of my favorite DJs from my DJ stint in Chicago back in the 80s, Jeff Pazen, filled up a Nano with music and made a few great playlists for me. They were playlists by club, year and tone. I nearly stopped carrying my iPod around and just carried the Nano picking the playlist that best suited my mood. It was like playing that favorite DJ tape over and over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem was, the iTunes Music Store music was registered under Jeff's name. In other words the Nano was "loaned" to me, so I didn't really own the music. I could listen to it directly from the Nano, but on on my computer or elsewhere. When I played the Nano through the computer, it would get stuff on the licensed music. I started buying the songs from the music store, one by one by hand. Then I noticed that there was an operation that said it would convert the ownership to me and copy over the songs with my copies. I, stupidly, thought it would be a fast way for me to purchase the songs on the playlists that I didn't own. Instead of doing that, it "reset" the Nano to an empty state. I was devastated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Tower Records Japan says, "no music, no life." So content I had been with the Jeff Nano, I hadn't been playing with last.fm that much lately so I decided to fire it up. Congrats guy on a great redesign. I fell back in love with &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/user/joi/"&gt;last.fm&lt;/a&gt; which saved my day. I had left the comfy familiarity of the Nano and enjoyed wandering along a sometimes annoying but fun and eclectic musical journey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Browsing the playlists of various people I know or saw, I realized how different my taste was from many people I know and like. One in thing that struck me was how even after almost 20 years, Jeff's taste in music, even the new stuff, hit the spot for me and was perfect. Somehow, during my immersion in the music scene, my musical taste was set on some trajectory that included cycles. Somehow I am still in sync with Jeff. I'm not sure what this means exactly, but I found it interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I sat listening to radios of various people, I realized that continuing this process for a long time would make your "taste" appear similar to theirs and you would eventually show up in their neighborhood on last.fm as someone with similar taste. This would be a kind of weird stalking method if you were obsessed with someone enough to listen to their music collection all day every day. ;-P&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conversely, I won't say who, but looking at their music, I realized how difficult it would be to hang out with them too long even though I consider them my friend. I don't think I could ever take a road trip with someone who didn't share any favorite artists with me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer/Disclosure: I'm an investor in last.fm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/08/01/nano_kabamo.html#comments" title="Comment"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/08/01/nano_kabamo.html#trackbacks" title="Trackback"&gt;TrackBack&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

      <title>CGM Marketing Launch</title>
      <link>http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/07/27/cgm_marketing_launch.html</link>
      <author/>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Last night was the launch party of CGM Marketing. It is a joint venture between &lt;a href="http://www.garage.co.jp/"&gt;Digital Garage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.adk.jp/english/"&gt;Asatsu DK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.dentsu.com/"&gt;Dentsu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cci.co.jp/"&gt;Cyber Communications (CCI)&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="http://www.garage.co.jp/en/news/dg_news/dgn060703.html"&gt;Press release&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I co-founded Digital Garage in 1994. My little web/IT company called Eccosys made a joint venture with and later merged with the Garage group headed by Kaoru Hayashi. The Garage group was involved in advertising, marketing and content. We were their little Internet engine that could. In the early days of Eccosys, I had been talking to Yahoo about doing Yahoo Japan. After Softbank invested, it was clear that I wasn't going to get to run Yahoo Japan. I was offered 1% of Softbank Japan by Masa Son, but I turned it down. (Maybe I should have taken it. ;-P) Soon after, I was contacted from a friend at Infoseek about starting Infoseek Japan. We quickly shifted gears and started getting Infoseek Japan up. Softbank set up a joint venture with Dentsu, the #1 ad agency in Japan and called it Cyber Communications. They were tasked with figuring out how to sell ads on Yahoo Japan and interfacing with the agencies. We turned around and got &lt;a href="http://www.hakuhodo.jp/"&gt;Hakuhodo&lt;/a&gt; the #2 agency, Asatsu the #3 agency, Daiichi Kikaku, Yomiuri Kokoku and Daiko and created the &lt;a href="http://www.dac.co.jp/"&gt;Digital Advertising Consortium (DAC)&lt;/a&gt;. In aggregate, these ad agencies approximately equalled Dentsu in size.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infoseek had pioneered the idea of CPM ads, selling inventory based on impressions. At the time, none of the ad agencies liked the idea or thought they could sell it to their customers. They understood television GRP, but it was really a measurement of effect. The notion that you could sell ads by how many people actually viewed it, instead of the "value of the spot" was sort of a non-starter. We set up a study group/feasibilty study period for six months where we had people from all of the member agencies come together and talk and learn and eventually try to explain to sales teams in their respective groups. Infoseek launch around 6 months after Yahoo Japan, and we launched with a healthy rotation of ads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually, Internet ads were a big success and and CCI and DAC are now both public companies. &lt;a href="http://www.infoseek.co.jp/"&gt;Infoseek Japan&lt;/a&gt; now lives inside of Rakuten and is still one of the top portals in Japan, outliving the parent which was purchased and smothered inside of Disney.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In reflection, Infoseek and "home pages" didn't take off in the way I imagined. I thought we would have a lot more personal publishing. Instead, we ended up with big sites that were for all practical purposes, professional media sites. I had dreams of "the death of advertising" 10 years ago and had thought that personal publishing and targeted advertising would disinter-mediate some of the lying and stupidity. We didn't get that far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So here we are - blogs, wikis, tags, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com"&gt;Technorati&lt;/a&gt;, RSS/Atom, and the web looks a lot more like what I had envisioned 10 years ago. The online ad business is more innovative than its old media counterpart, but it has become mostly an inventory/sales business. So lets try this again. This time, we decided to hook up with Dentsu the #1 ad agency, Asatsu the #3 ad agency and CCI, the competitor to the company we set up to sell Infoseek ads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although I don't like the word "Consumer" in the "Consumer Generated Media Marketing" name, the idea behind this company is to try to take it the next step. (I wish we could use "user") At the first meeting yesterday, I said that I thought that advertising, PR and marketing would converge into "communications". That companies that created or improved good/great products would communicate with their users and that it was about getting involved in the conversation. It was not about spending money to force yourself in front of people who didn't want to hear about your message. It was also not about charging people to participate in "content". It was about people having conversation and about companies knowing when, how and where to say the right thing so that they contributed to the conversation and were welcome in it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clearly, the first step is to figure out things like ads that are smart about blogs, tags, time, context. It is also about treating the blogger and the advertiser equally where the ads reflected the desire of the person having the conversation as well as the desires of companies to participate in them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was saying all of this in a room full of ad agency executives. It is always sort of funny talking about the end of people's businesses. On the other hand, many of the senior members there were the same guys I was talking to 10 years ago trying to explain CPM and banner ads. I felt privileged to be allowed some suspension of disbelief as well as some trust that we'd try to figure out where the business was. (I don't think anyone REALLY thought that DAC was going to become a public company 10 years ago.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think the world is more complex than back in the Infoseek days, but we have a lot more experience and trust this time around. It was a really nice feeling shaking hands with people I hadn't seen for almost a decade - all of us very eager to work together again. This time we get to skip the phase where they think I'm crazy and jump right into figuring out the ad business around &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.jp/home.html"&gt;Technorati Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sixapart.jp/"&gt;Six Apart Japan&lt;/a&gt; and hopefully soon Japanese &lt;a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Wikia"&gt;Wikia&lt;/a&gt;. Technorati is the "secret sauce" and shiny new thing that Infoseek had been 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am going to be on the board of this company, but will not run it. My role will be to bring new things to them, try to help them with their bearings and stir things up once in awhile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosures/disclaimer: I am an investor in Technorati, Six Apart and Wikia. I'm an advisor to Digital Garage. Digital Garage is the Japanese partner for Technorati and operates Technorati Japan. I am on the board of and GM of International for Technorati, I am the chairman of Six Apart Japan. I am on the board of Technorati Japan and and am involved heavily in its operation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/07/27/cgm_marketing_launch.html#comments" title="Comment"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/07/27/cgm_marketing_launch.html#trackbacks" title="Trackback"&gt;TrackBack&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

You can downloaded it &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/socialtext/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Over 2,000 businesses run Socialtext Wiki products today as a hosted service or appliance." I'm on the board of Socialtext and we've been talking about doing this for a long time. Socialtext has always been an open source contributor, but this is a fairly important step forward and a shift in the business model. I think this puts Socialtext solidly on the right side of the open source movement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Congratulations Ross et all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- technorati tags start --&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:right;font-size:10px;"&gt;Technorati Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/opensource" rel="tag"&gt;opensource&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tag/socialtext" rel="tag"&gt;socialtext&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- technorati tags end --&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/07/25/open_source_socialtext.html#comments" title="Comment"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/07/25/open_source_socialtext.html#trackbacks" title="Trackback"&gt;TrackBack&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

Danny has &lt;a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/blogg_post/eng/555/"&gt;uploaded some photos&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cosplay is a practice with origins in Japan that came out of the Anime community where fans dressed up as their favorite Anime characters. The culture is spreading to the US, but Akihabara is one of the centers of Cosplay. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay"&gt;Wikipedia has a good article on Cosplay&lt;/a&gt;. It turned out that a number of Firefox users were Cosplay fans and showed up in their wear to help out in Akihabara. They were a big hit. The while maid Cosplay thing is very big in Japan - especially in Akihabara. There are Cosplay Cafes and even Maid Cosplay Cafes. The whole maid thing is an interesting phenomenon and isn't as fetish driven as it might appear at first glance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, big thanks to everyone who showed up to helps, especially the Cosplayers. (&lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/11/27/cosplay_or_costume.html"&gt;I blogged about my little Cosplay party a few years ago&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There &lt;a href="http://getfirefox.jp/promo/2006/summer/special/"&gt;is a big event in Kamakura tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; so if you're in Japan, please come join the fun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/07/21/firefox_cosplayarama.html#comments" title="Comment"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/07/21/firefox_cosplayarama.html#trackbacks" title="Trackback"&gt;TrackBack&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

      <title>The War Tapes</title>
      <link>http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/06/29/the_war_tapes.html</link>
      <author/>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;I just saw a screening of the film "&lt;a href="http://www.thewartapes.com/"&gt;The War Tapes&lt;/a&gt;", a documentary about soldiers in Iraq by soldiers in Iraq. The director Deborah Scranton is telling the story now. She was asked by the National Guard to do a documentary as an embedded journalist. Instead, she suggested that they give cameras to the soldiers and let them shoot the film. Soldiers were given cameras and she directed &lt;strike&gt;coordinated the editing&lt;/strike&gt; via IM&lt;strike&gt; and email&lt;/strike&gt;. The result is an amazingly candid and real film and it gave me a better view of what it is like to be a soldier in Iraq than anything else I've ever seen. Regardless of whether you support the war or not, I suggest you see this film.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also gives me another perspective on the soldiers and the spouses of soldiers that I have met in our &lt;a href="http://weknow.to/"&gt;World of Warcraft guild&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;UPDATE: She directed the film by IM and it was edited when the soldiers returned from Iraq.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/06/29/the_war_tapes.html#comments" title="Comment"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/06/29/the_war_tapes.html#trackbacks" title="Trackback"&gt;TrackBack&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;They just announced that the conference is on the record (yay!) but there are no photos allowed (boo!). They cited security reasons. I have a feeling maybe &lt;a href="http://www.defamer.com/topic/iming-michael-eisner-017736.php"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; had something to do with it. (disclaimer: I had nothing to do with the "derivative work")&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/06/29/no_photos_from_fortune_brainstorm_2006.html#comments" title="Comment"&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/06/29/no_photos_from_fortune_brainstorm_2006.html#trackbacks" title="Trackback"&gt;TrackBack&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

      <content>&lt;p&gt;Just the other day I was surfing around and I stumbled upon a blog that was using a very familiar design. Hmmmm, now where have I seen that style before?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, it was created by one of the contestants from &lt;a href="http://www.thestylecontest.com/"&gt;The Style Contest&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And just like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; my day became a good one. I didn’t expect to feel so much pride in what we were able to accomplish with the contest. And where I once referred to only a hand full of people when I said "we," I can now safely refer to at least 70 people, from contest organizers, to designers, to all the &lt;a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/eric/"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://onpodsessions.com/"&gt;using&lt;/a&gt; those styles on their blog. And do you know what else is so encouraging? Getting emails from people wishing to submit more designs to the web site even after the contest is over. What better indicator is there to demonstrate our success then the community's continued interest in contributing styles just for the sake of the greater good?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have even seen these styles being &lt;a href="http://blogger-templates.blogspot.com/"&gt;ported to Blogger&lt;/a&gt; as well, which is not just a great endorsement of the quality of the designers' work, but also of the promise of a &lt;a href="http://www.majordojo.com/design/why_we_need_a_design_standard.php"&gt;weblog HTML standard&lt;/a&gt; which serves to benefit our collective users more than anyone else -- and isn’t that what its all about?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what has been happening on the Six Apart front since we &lt;a href="http://www.thestylecontest.com/announcements/and_the_winners_are"&gt;announced the winners&lt;/a&gt;? Well a lot of energy as of late has been focused on bringing a vast majority of the styles to &lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com/"&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt;. To all of those people who grew &lt;a href="http://www.thestylecontest.com/announcements/more_samples"&gt;frustrated&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.thestylecontest.com/announcements/more_accessible_templates"&gt;LiveJournal land&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="http://www.thestylecontest.com/announcements/more_samples"&gt;TypePad and Movable Type bias&lt;/a&gt;, I cannot tell you how helpful and valuable all your feedback was during the process. It is because of you that we learned so much and as a result why LiveJournal will be the first of our hosted products to get these designs available to them at the click of a button. So to all of you LJers out there, stay tuned, and be patient, it won’t be long until you have over a hundred new styles and themes to choose from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now what about &lt;a href="http://www.typepad.com/"&gt;TypePad&lt;/a&gt;? TypePad will get them too. In fact TypePad is next. In the meantime Pro users can take advantage of &lt;a href="http://www.thestylecontest.com/browse/"&gt;Style Contest Styles&lt;/a&gt; immediately by using the &lt;a href="http://help.typepad.com/tips/custom_css.html"&gt;Custom CSS feature&lt;/a&gt;. The only caveat is that you need to upload all of the style’s background images and other assets into your TypePad account. But that is pretty straightforward using TypePad’s &lt;a href="http://support.typepad.com/cgi-bin/typepad.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=166"&gt;File Manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Naturally, &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/"&gt;Movable Type&lt;/a&gt; users can use all of these styles right now using the &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/stylecatcher.html"&gt;Style Catcher plugin&lt;/a&gt; -- which, if you’re using &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/news/2006/07/a_blog_for_ever.html"&gt;Movable Type 3.3&lt;/a&gt;, you already have installed. Its actually kind of fun -- I wasted far too much of one of my work days installing 100 different styles to &lt;a href="http://www.majordojo.com/"&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And that about sums up Six Apart. What about the &lt;a href="http://www.movalog.com/"&gt;Arvind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.plasticmind.com/"&gt;Jesse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.elise.com/"&gt;Elise&lt;/a&gt; (the organizers of the contest)? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They have been working on a new website called "The Style Archive" which will serve as a permanent repository and library for all the styles build to support the blog HTML standard. It will also be a repository for new styles that designers have been agitating to add. That means that The Style Contest’s website will be freed up for future contests!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what are you waiting for? Go try out some of the &lt;a href="http://www.thestylecontest.com/browse/"&gt;new styles&lt;/a&gt;, and feel free to pass the link along to any of your friends whose blogs are looking a little long in the tooth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, if you are using a style from the contest, let us know by leaving a comment, and we might give you some link love!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=CaNcyvt3"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=CaNcyvt3" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=GJT7wySP"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=GJT7wySP" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=iBGge3ao"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=iBGge3ao" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=nynaw60V"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=nynaw60V" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SixApartNews/~4/13164423"/&gt;</content>http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2006/08/post_3.html</entry>

      <content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Turbo Gopher" src="http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/turbogopher.gif" width="244" height="182" style="float : right; padding : 10px;" /&gt; Thanks to Jason Kottke’s &lt;a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/08/gopher-still-going"&gt;recent blog post about Gopher&lt;/a&gt;, people are discovering or rediscovering &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_protocol"&gt;Gopher&lt;/a&gt;. Gopher is a text-based system for navigating documents on the Internet that was extremely popular in the early 90s and helped create and influence a lot of the content and culture that’s now shared via the World Wide Web. Today, we follow links to sites with &lt;code&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning of them, but in 1992, it was much more common to follow a &lt;code&gt;gopher://&lt;/code&gt; link, which still works in browsers like Firefox today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the great things about working with Six Apart is that we don’t just get to work with people who know technology really well, sometimes we get to work with the people who &lt;em&gt;invented&lt;/em&gt; them. One of the best examples is &lt;strong&gt;Paul Lindner&lt;/strong&gt;, who’s been with Six Apart for years, working on infrastructure for our blogging services. Paul was one of Gopher’s creators, and we thought with the resurgence of interest that it’d be a nice chance to ask Paul a few questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, short and sweet, how would you describe what Gopher is? How does it work?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Imagine a dead simple browsing experience optimized for hierarchical menus and documents. Think old-school AOL, think about your favorite dialup BBS, or your WAP-enabled phone. You look at a menu, select or search, get another menu or a document, repeat.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of us are familiar with the World Wide Web – how are HTML and HTTP different from Gopher?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;HTML is an open ended markup language based off of SGML. Gopher uses a very simple text format that describes how to display a menu of items on the screen. These menus can be static (like a simple directory) or the results of a search.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gopher protocol is quite similar to the earliest HTTP/0.9 protocol. You send an opaque string to the server and get back results &amp;#8212; a menu, an image, a sound or a document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of &lt;a href="http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/util/gopher/gophercon1.txt"&gt;GopherCon ‘92&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/"&gt;Ed Vielmetti&lt;/a&gt; was talking about how Gopher had basically surpassed WWW in common usage. Today, the WWW is ubiquitous, and Ed&amp;#8217;s got a TypePad blog – what factors do you think influenced that change?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gopher&amp;#8217;s simplicity and wide availibility of clients and servers for low-end hardware caused it&amp;#8217;s rapid growth starting in late 1991. The Gopher team wrote software for microcomputers of the day &amp;#8212; the Mac SE and PC-AT. Gopher clients and servers ran well on those platforms and opened up internet information browsing and publishing to a whole new group of people that couldn&amp;#8217;t fathom FTP and couldn&amp;#8217;t tell you what a hostname was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time the &lt;a href="http://www.yedit.com/web-content-management-system/201-web-beginning.html"&gt;World Wide Web&lt;/a&gt; was only available via a clunky line-mode terminal client or a NeXT Browser and was primarily used by a small group of researchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That all changed in late 1993. Versions of the Mosaic web browser were released for Windows and Mac. With Mosaic you could display web pages with pretty images, in addition to all the existing Gopher sites. It was very impressive and quickly added features that users wanted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And finally, the one thing that most killed Gopher was something it could never support &amp;#8212; Banner advertisements. In 1993 O&amp;#8217;Reilly&amp;#8217;s Global Network Navigator became the first advertiser supported web site, followed shortly thereafter by HotWired (where Six Apart&amp;#8217;s own Andrew Anker was CEO). Online advertising along with the privatization of the NSFnet backbone finally solved the question of how to pay for content online.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good history, including a Gopher vs Web graph is available &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5242252.stm"&gt;on the BBC website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is this an example in some ways of &lt;a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html"&gt;worse is better&lt;/a&gt;, where sometimes the solution that succeeds isn’t always going to be the most theoretically perfect?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think so. Gopher and the World Wide Web are both far from perfect. Both of them were built up in an organic manner responding to the user needs at the time. Gopher replaced hundreds of home-grown Campus-Wide-Information-Systems and helped all kinds of people access information quickly and easily. The World Wide Web has been used and abused for just about every computing problem known.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most theoretically perfect hypertext system I&amp;#8217;ve used was called &lt;a href="http://www.byte.com/art/9511/sec5/art4.htm"&gt;Hyper-G&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone on the Gopher team really thought it would take over where the World Wide Web left off. It really was an amazing system and has features that have yet to be grafted onto the existing Web including bi-directional links and document clustering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;What kind of constraints did you face in getting Gopher running?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campus politics nearly killed Gopher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gopher was a classic skunk-works project. The various computing fiefdoms of the University could not agree on the best way to build a campus-wide information system. A grand committee was formed and after nine months passed came up with a protocol design that satisfied nobody.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I worked in the Microcomputer group where we helped people use the new Macs and PCs of the day. We really needed a a way to publish information online that was simple and easy. So we made the decision to proceed build a working system to get around the committee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After three weeks of nights and weekends we had had assembled clients and servers for Unix, Mac and PC, plus a search engine that ran on a NeXT cube. We refined over the next two months and developed content &amp;#8212; the ever popular USENET recipe collection, a searchable UPI newsfeed and an online version of our knowledge base. All told it was slam dunk. All the features that average users wanted, along with protocol documents, open source code and a howto guide to running your own server.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alas, that didn&amp;#8217;t go over so well on campus. For a while we were even forced to call our system the &amp;#8216;Gopher Consultant&amp;#8217; so no one thought it was somehow official. That changed once other Universities adopted Gopher as their own and the campus politics began to go our way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later on we encountered technical constraints running the world&amp;#8217;s top level Gopher site. At one point we had a cluster of 9 recycled Apple Macintosh Mac IIci computers running Apple&amp;#8217;s A/UX operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gopher had a strong hierarchy to its documents – some people are trying to reproduce that kind of hierarchical organization system in a web context today with efforts like OPML. But Yahoo’s recent homepage redesign actually removed the directory that used to be the top level of their giant hierarchy. Is there still a place for that kind of top-down organization on today’s web?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there will always be a place for global directories based on a constrained set of keywords or subject areas. This is what librarians do for a living so don&amp;#8217;t expect that to go away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One difference however is today&amp;#8217;s Web has transformed itself from the library model to a user oriented services model. Much of what we do today is not &amp;#8216;web browsing&amp;#8217;, but &amp;#8216;web using&amp;#8217;. Browser based games, shopping, chat and blogging are all interactive activities. The &lt;a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/"&gt;Yahoo Directory&lt;/a&gt; (yes it&amp;#8217;s still there!) is now just an application that helps you find web sites you might like.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If anything the tools today make it much easier to build directories. Blogging tools, tagging and the Semantic Web have all resulted in a much better organized Web compared to personal home pages of old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, you’re helping people communicate with blogs these days – did you ever forsee people using these Internet technologies for everyday communication between non-techie audiences?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I, and many others, anticipated that the Internet would change how average people communicate. We had already seen what the POP protocol could do for E-Mail. We knew that Internet-connected publishing could make accessible the vast islands of information already out there, plus make it easy to put new information online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any final thoughts?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to acknowledge what a privilege it was to work on the Gopher Team. Shih-Pau Yen, Mark McCahill, Farhad Anklesaria, George Gonzalez, Daniel Torrey, and Bob Alberti are some of the greatest people I&amp;#8217;ve ever worked with. Together we changed the way the world uses the Internet.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paul had a good post on our blog a few years ago in our series of &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2004/09/behind_the_scenes.html"&gt;behind the scenes&lt;/a&gt; posts. And some more good news: If you want a chance to pick the brains of smart folks like Paul every day, &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/jobs/"&gt;we’re hiring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=LLIIakRQ"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=LLIIakRQ" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=XPcykCvY"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=XPcykCvY" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=QI49gP92"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=QI49gP92" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=8ok5XiQC"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=8ok5XiQC" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SixApartNews/~4/9808970"/&gt;</content>http://www.sixapart.com/about/news/2006/08/digging_up_info.html</entry>

As always, you can have affiliate links or AdSense or a tip jar on your personal blog. And there&amp;#8217;s dozens of &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/capabilities/"&gt;new capabilities&lt;/a&gt; in Movable Type 3.3 that make it well worth the upgrade, including support for tags, widgets, huge improvements to the templating language, and activity feeds that let you manage all of your blog&amp;#8217;s activity right from a single feed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, one of the best parts of the Movable Type platform is that we offer &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/pricing"&gt;professional support&lt;/a&gt; for it. So you can buy support for your personal blog directly from us, and right now, it&amp;#8217;s just $49.95/year. Cheap!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honestly, we&amp;#8217;ve put a lot of work into making Movable Type a professional tool, and that&amp;#8217;s the reason it&amp;#8217;s the most popular blogging platform for businesses, organizations, and professionals. But we know that personal bloggers are an important part of our community, and our success with businesses (and now with &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/capabilities/enterprise/"&gt;enterprises&lt;/a&gt;) helps us make Movable Type free for the individuals that want a professional-grade tool for their personal blogs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So give the new version a try. If you want support, get a license and talk to our help team &amp;#8212; you&amp;#8217;ll find out why people rave about our support. And don&amp;#8217;t forget to mention us to your boss or your coworkers when they start asking, &amp;#8220;Hey, should our company get a blog?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=65EmXPhh"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=65EmXPhh" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=4guTZ1VD"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=4guTZ1VD" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=V5Zx7qH5"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=V5Zx7qH5" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=OSnygpx2"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=OSnygpx2" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SixApartNews/~4/9244617"/&gt;</content>http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/news/2006/08/movable-type-free.html</entry>

If you&amp;#8217;ve been tuning out, there&amp;#8217;s a push from telcos to create tiered service for Internet access, based on charging more for different classes of connection. &lt;a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000069C1-3873-14C0-AFE483414B7F4945&amp;amp;sc=I100322"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt; published a pretty fair editorial on the topic, which reaches a clear conclusion:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;A system for prioritizing data traffic might well be necessary someday, yet one might hope that it would be based on the needs of the transmissions rather than the deal making and caprices of the cable owners. Moreover, personal blogs and other Web pages are increasingly patchworks of media components from various sources. Tiered service would stultify that trend.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;That seems like a reasonable analysis, so the natural next step for any Internet-related cause is to get a good website going to help with advocacy. Enter &lt;a href="http://www.itsournet.org/"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Our Net&lt;/a&gt;, supported by everyone from Adobe to Yahoo, and sponsored by Amazon, eBay, Google, InterActiveCorp, Microsoft, and Yahoo! . It&amp;#8217;s a simple, effective site combining the latest news, information about how the proposed change would affect the web, and tools to contact your elected officials. We&amp;#8217;re also proud to note that the entire site is powered by &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/"&gt;Movable Type&lt;/a&gt;. We don&amp;#8217;t like to preach too much, but it&amp;#8217;s important enough to take a few minutes to visit the site and help spread the word.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=Ewhr17V7"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=Ewhr17V7" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=PvBg2tLY"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=PvBg2tLY" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=1mpG4vg0"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=1mpG4vg0" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=ArEMMcPI"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=ArEMMcPI" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SixApartNews/~4/9025833"/&gt;</content>http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/news/2006/08/its_our_net.html</entry>

      <content>&lt;p&gt;If we mentioned a hosted web service that’s been around since 1999, offering powerful blogging, RSS publishing, RSS aggregation, a river-of-news style view of posts, and the ability to export any of your feed lists as OPML, you’d probably think “Didn’t &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/"&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt; make that?” Well, he probably did, but we’d also be describing &lt;a href="http://www.livejournal.com/"&gt;LiveJournal&lt;/a&gt;. One thing we’ve found in &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2006/07/six_apart_at_os.html"&gt;visiting&lt;/a&gt; the O’Reilly Open Source Convention last week is that lots of people still don’t know about the pretty cool technologies that power the 10 million-strong LiveJournal community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ll be publishing some detailed geek explanations of LiveJournal’s &lt;a href="http://code.sixapart.com/"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; soon, including such mellifluously named staples as Memcached, MogileFS, Perlbal, and Djabberd. But if you haven’t given LiveJournal a second look in a while (or in half a decade), it might be worth revisiting. This is especially true now that cool new features like LJ Talk, our Jabber-compatible instant messaging integration, are launching soon. And if you happen to connect to some pretty cool communities as a result of playing with the technology, well, that’s okay too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=OVRx2C4B"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=OVRx2C4B" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=oiER05zu"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=oiER05zu" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=nYrYEPxd"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=nYrYEPxd" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=vzFD9VmW"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=vzFD9VmW" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SixApartNews/~4/7818112"/&gt;</content>http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/weblog/2006/07/rss_river_of_ne.html</entry>

The Wired cover story explored the impact that improved searching and better filters have had on selling products and services, making it possible to profit from items that aren't "hits" in the Top 100 sense. Increasingly, Anderson suggests, niche products that alone sell relatively few units will together make up the majority of sales for many businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The idea has become one of the most popular memes for bloggers who write about business and culture, and over the past 20 months has taken hold in the mainstream as thinkers and consumers alike realize the implications of the shift. And Hyperion has just published Anderson's book &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401302378/"&gt;The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; in hardcover. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;On Monday, July 24 at 1:30 PM PDT, we'll be hosting &lt;a href="https://skypecasts.skype.com/skypecasts/skypecast/detailed.html?id_talk=17623"&gt;a moderated SkypeCast discussion&lt;/a&gt; with Anderson.&lt;/strong&gt; To participate, all you'll need is &lt;a href="http://www.skype.com/download/"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; and this link: &lt;a href="http://skypecasts.skype.com/"&gt;skypecasts.skype.com&lt;/a&gt;.

      <content>&lt;p&gt;When we started offering professional support and paid licenses for &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype"&gt;Movable Type&lt;/a&gt; over two years ago, the idea of business blogging wasn't obvious nor was the need for a reliable blogging vendor that a company could trust as a partner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since then, the power of &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/business"&gt;business blogging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; become obvious. So we've increased our commitment to Movable Type, the world's &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/business/movable-type"&gt;preferred platform for business blogging&lt;/a&gt;. The most visible result of which is the release of a new update, &lt;strong&gt;Movable Type version 3.3&lt;/strong&gt;, along with an entirely &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; product, &lt;strong&gt;Movable Type Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/press/2006/07/six_apart_relea.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; contains a wealth of information that will give you a high-level overview of what this means for Movable Type users and businesses looking to get into blogging. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For both products, we've got dozens of compelling and unique new features, focused on improving productivity, and making it possible not just to succeed with your blogs, but to &lt;em&gt;manage&lt;/em&gt; that success after your blog takes off. If you're a current user of Movable Type, you will soon wonder how you ever blogged without them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Discount prices for businesses, and free for personal users&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of being a reliable platform for business blogging is making sure we have a solid business model to back our world-class support team and the new investment we've made in development. One of the nice side effects of being successful with our business customers is that we can share the benefits with our entire community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/pricing_commercial"&gt;Movable Type commercial licenses&lt;/a&gt; are now available with deep discounts through the summer and Movable Type Enterprise is being launched with a promotion offering &lt;em&gt;45% off the regular price&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We also continue to make our personal license for Movable Type even more open: The &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/pricing"&gt;personal version&lt;/a&gt; of Movable Type is now &lt;em&gt;completely free, and supports &lt;strong&gt;as many blogs and authors as you want&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Of course, we continue to offer paid support as an option for personal blogs, along with services such as professional installation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Experience with enterprise blogging&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, we're not content to just repackage a personal blogging tool with a different price tag and call it an &lt;em&gt;enterprise application&lt;/em&gt;. IT and IS departments have a tightly defined set of expectations and requirements that we've come to understand from the thousands of customers already using Movable Type.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For that reason, we've made Movable Type Enterprise available with &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/capabilities/enterprise/"&gt;exclusive features&lt;/a&gt; for integrating with the platforms enterprises depend on. We've also expanded our support offerings with &lt;strong&gt;priority support&lt;/strong&gt; for enterprise customers, backed by the best support team in blogging, offering years of experience in supporting business blogs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you are an independent consultant, a small firm or a multinational corporation, we've got the blogging software you're looking for. The Movable Type family of products will not only suit your needs now, but will grow with you as your blogs become a success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Related links&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existing users:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://secure.sixapart.com/t/account"&gt;Log into your account&lt;/a&gt; to download the update&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/capabilities/enterprise/"&gt;Movable Type Enterprise features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/docs/enterprise/"&gt;Movable Type Enterprise documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/capabilities/"&gt;Movable Type 3.3 features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/docs/"&gt;Movable Type 3.3 documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/docs/3.3/h_changelog/3_3.html"&gt;Movable Type 3.3 changelog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The update to Movable Type is being initially released as version 3.31 to sync version numbers with an earlier release in our Japanese market, MT 3.3-ja.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=gm6QL96C"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=gm6QL96C" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=YAwoH9Nw"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=YAwoH9Nw" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=sF0q5yN3"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=sF0q5yN3" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=LYD3mR67"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=LYD3mR67" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SixApartNews/~4/1120973"/&gt;</content>http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/news/2006/07/a_blog_for_ever.html</entry>

We experienced a database problem and needed to take the system offline to repair it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weblogs were never down, and the application came back up about 7:30 pm PDT.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you made any changes to your weblog during the period 12:30 am to 10:30 am PDT, while the application was available intermittently before we took it down, you may need to take steps to restore those posts from your archives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This does not affect all users, but only those who posted between 12:30 am and 10:30 am. If you did not make any changes to your weblog between 12:30 am and 10:30 am on July 12th, your weblog content will not be affected by the application downtime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you did post during this period, these posts are not available inside of TypePad.

The article also features some &lt;a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/blog/2006/07/top_five_science_blogs.html"&gt;great sidebars&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060703/multimedia/science_blog_by_writers.html"&gt;a list of science blogs by non-scientist writers&lt;/a&gt;, an explanation of how &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060703/multimedia/how.html"&gt;their list was made&lt;/a&gt;, and some &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060703/multimedia/blogshots.html"&gt;stats about science blogs&lt;/a&gt;. There's some really fantastic blogging featured in the story, and even if you're not a scientist yourself, who could help but be charmed by blogs with names like &lt;a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula"&gt;Pharyngula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/"&gt;The Panda's Thumb&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.cscs.umich.edu/%7Ecrshalizi/weblog"&gt;Three-Toed Sloth&lt;/a&gt;? And as satisfying as it is to see this great science blogging going on, we're also proud that 30 of the &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060703/multimedia/50_science_blogs.html"&gt;fifty most popular science blogs&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; has identified are powered by Movable Type. We're not experts at blogometrology, but we're pretty sure that's statistically significant. Naturally, &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; has its own Movable Type-powered &lt;a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/blog/"&gt;news blog&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=p7TLAow8"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=p7TLAow8" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=MdBdHcWX"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=MdBdHcWX" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=9CFUKXfD"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=9CFUKXfD" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=nlcERtY8"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=nlcERtY8" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/SixApartNews?g=567"/&gt;</content>http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/news/2006/07/scientific_proo.html</entry>

      <content>&lt;p&gt;We just pushed out a sizeable update of the &lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/"&gt;Movable Type plugin directory&lt;/a&gt; and thought we'd share with you those which are new and updated. Below are links to each with descriptions written in the authors' own words:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/newentrytemplat.html"&gt;NewEntryTemplate v1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Authoring, Built for 3.2, Shortcuts &lt;br /&gt; Allows setting global or per-blog default content for entry text fields. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/mtifcommenterem.html"&gt;MTIfCommenterEmailIs v1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Built for 3.2, Comments/TrackBacks, Community, Email &lt;br /&gt; This plugin adds a new MovableType conditionnal tag named MTIfCommenterEmailIs. It accepts two arguments: email (mandatory) and trusted. The aim is to recognise a commenter by its email address. If trusted is set to 1 then the comment must also be from an authentified source (typekey for example). You can use MTElse to add some code when the comment is not from the expected source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/filesize.html"&gt;FileSize v1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Built for 3.2 &lt;br /&gt; Get the filesize of a file. Accepts inline MT tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/ljsubs.html"&gt;LJsubs v1.2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Administrative, Authoring, Built for 3.2, Text Formatting &lt;br /&gt; If you're porting a LiveJournal to MovableType, this will make the transition all the more easier. This MT plugin contains a text filter that translates most LiveJournal-specific tags, and formats your entry according to normal LJ practice. That is, anything inside an lj-raw container gets left alone, and anything outside gets a linebreak appended to the end of each line. Other common LJ tags get translated, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/moderate_via_de.html"&gt;Moderate Via Delay v1.03&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Anti-spam, Built for 3.2, Comments/TrackBacks &lt;br /&gt; The plugin has a junk filter that can moderate comments and trackbacks that are submitted a certain amount of time after the original entry was posted, or after the last comment/trackback was posted. You can also flag such comments as junk instead of moderating them, and even scale the junk rating so that it increases the longer the entry has been idle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/addcomment.html"&gt;AddComment v1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Administrative, Built for 3.2, Comments/TrackBacks, Shortcuts &lt;br /&gt; Allows posting comments right from Movable Type's backend. It adds an "Add Comment" form in the "Comments" tab when editing an entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/macron.html"&gt;Macron v1.1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Authoring, Built for 3.2 &lt;br /&gt; Adds a button above the entry editing area to easily add a macron to any character. A macron is a "mark placed over a vowel to indicate that the vowel is long" (Webster). It can be used for example in romanized Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/mtmaps.html"&gt;MTMaps v0.6&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Built for 3.2, Web Services, Widgets &lt;br /&gt; MTMaps lets you easily create Google Maps that show where each of your blog entries occurred. It's perfect for PhotoBlogging, TravelBlogging, diaries, or collaboration - any time you want to show the world where your blog is happening!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/mycomments.html"&gt;myComments v1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Built for 3.2, Comments/TrackBacks, Web Services &lt;br /&gt; This plugin sends approved comments to myComments service (http://mycomments.idslab.com.ar/) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/tagsupplemental.html"&gt;TagSupplementals v0.02&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Authoring, Built for 3.3, Categories, Keywords, Linking, Search, Tagging &lt;br /&gt; TagSupplementals Plugin is intended to provide supplemental features, in addition to the standard MT 3.3 tags for tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/entrycategoryen.html"&gt;EntryCategoryEntries v0.01&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Built for 3.2, Categories &lt;br /&gt; EntryCategoryEntries plugin allows you to list entries included in the primary category of the current entry. This plugin can be used only in the entry context, which means the inside of the MTEntries container or the individual entry archives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/duplicated_tbpi.html"&gt;Duplicated TBPing Lookup v1.02&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Anti-spam, Built for 3.2, Comments/TrackBacks &lt;br /&gt; An MT 3.2 JunkFilter plugin for rejecting duplicated and/or repeated trackbacks from the same source URLs.

A live preview, perhaps the most requested feature yet, allows you to view an entry in your weblog's context, i.e. with all the styling applied to it, rather than with Movable Type, as with the default previewing mechanism. It has several advantages, the biggest being that you no longer have to save and publish your entry to view it in context. Hence, you can identify any potential problems with your entry well in advance of publishing it. A screencast of LivePreview in action is available!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/google_pagerank.html"&gt;Google PageRank v0.1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Statistics, Web Services, Widgets &lt;br /&gt; This plugin allow you add the Google PageRank of the current blog into your pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/google_analytic.html"&gt;Google Analytics v0.2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Administrative, Blogosphere, Statistics, Template/Tag Helpers, Web Services &lt;br /&gt; This plugin makes it simple to add Google Analytics codes to your weblog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/plugins/plugin/akismet.html"&gt;Akismet v1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Categories:&lt;/strong&gt; Anti-spam, Built for 3.2, Comments/TrackBacks, Web Services &lt;br /&gt; Filters the contents of incoming feedback using the &lt;a href="http://akismet.com/"&gt;Akismet&lt;/a&gt; service.

We were getting good -- too good -- at giving customers complicated instructions on how to do that, and decided there had to be a better way. And that, dear reader, is how Widgets were born. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Which is why I’m thrilled today to announce Joshua Schachter and the other kind folks at del.icio.us added Widget support to their &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/help/linkrolls"&gt;Linkroll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/help/tagrolls"&gt;Tagroll&lt;/a&gt; features. If you’re a TypePad user, all you need to do to put your links or tags on the sidebar of your blog is sign in to del.icio.us, configure how you want your Linkroll or Tagroll to look, and click the "Add this to your TypePad blog" link under the box that has all the messy code (that you used to have to copy and paste). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many thanks to the del.icio.us team – the TypePad team couldn’t be happier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=Uke5V0Xo"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=Uke5V0Xo" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=MxUZrynd"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=MxUZrynd" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=TXkrz8nL"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=TXkrz8nL" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?a=DIWE7vWL"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/SixApartNews?i=DIWE7vWL" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/SixApartNews?g=565"/&gt;</content>http://www.sixapart.com/typepad/news/2006/07/two_delicious_w.html</entry>

      <content type="xhtml">Today, we announced some faster servers; I’m not a big-SPARC guy so the one that makes my heart go pitter-pat is the new Ultra; I just spent a week living on a year-old Ultra and while it’s damn fast, I managed to make it breathe hard with both JRuby and the Gimp. What’s more interesting is the PG&amp;E rebate. Check it out, but what’s even more interesting, to me, is that there are three ways you can read about it: Jonathan’s blog, the Sun.com page, and the official press release. The blog is the most interesting, with the Craigslist reference and and the highway-rules context. If you want details, the Sun.com page is OK, with some sample calculations and so on. Which leaves the press release. It seems to have been carefully designed for unreadability, its meandering sentences studded with company chest-pounding and its stilted, committee-compromise quotes (even those from smart, genuine people like Dave Douglas) that no human voice would ever utter. Having said that, the press release contains some useful facts that aren’t in either Jonathan’s write-up or the Sun.com page. We (the world I mean) need to do marketing better.</content>

      <content type="xhtml">I am a long-time reader of The Economist; I give subscriptions to several of my loved ones every Christmas, and regard it as the most compact and efficient way to be reasonably well informed about the world’s realities. One has to route around their reflexive ideological filter (“Well, maybe child labour isn’t that bad if the market wants it”), but still, the quality of writing and thinking is generally very good. In the last couple of years, though, there’s been a slow steady trickle of horrid editorial lapses; some things can apparently make it onto the page without having passed through an intelligent person’s mind. This worries me, since I’d find it hard to replace if it went bad.AEILast year, in a discussion of the Bush administration’s failed attempt to privatize Social Security, the question arose of whether people would learn to manage their own savings. The Economist quoted an analyst from the American Enterprise Institute saying “No problem, they’ll learn.” Huh? The AEI is a primary architect of the Bush administration’s policies. You might as well ask Opus Dei about the Pope’s latest pronouncement.DellEarlier this year, in a discussion of Dell’s recent poor business performance, they went on and on about the kinds of computers they’re building and the markets they’re addressing, and somehow neglected to say a single word about Dell’s hideous technical-support problems, and the fact that they’ve made their formerly-great Web site hard to use.It’sTwice in the last year, they’ve had “it’s” where they meant “its”. Gimme a break, “its” and “it’s” are like “his” and “he’s” and that’s all you need to know; but apparently The Economist lets its pages go to press without basic literacy review?WomenIn the almost-current August 5-11 issue, there’s an interesting and intelligent article, The mismeasure of woman, about the study of genetically-driven differences in the male and female minds. But at the front of the magazine was a shorter leader, How women won the sex war, which was witty and amusing, then the last paragraph said “Wise chaps seeking professional advancement should therefore spend their free time with groups of women, boning up on how to undermine somebody's confidence while pretending to boost it, and how to turn an entire lunch table against an absent colleague without saying a mean word.” Excuse me, are there any grown-up editors or is it just a bunch of sniggering throwbacks?</content>

I don’t want to call it a “validator” because a feed can be said unambiguously to be valid, or not; but a publishing-system interface might be unusably buggy or slow or have moronic authentication policies; all the Exerciser (let’s just say “the Ape” for short) does is perform a bunch of operations that a typical APP client might, and report the results.

      <content type="xhtml">I’ve just put up a prototype of something I call the Atom Protocol Exerciser. It might evolve to become a sanity-checking tool something along the lines of the Feed Validator. I don’t want to call it a “validator” because a feed can be said unambiguously to be valid, or not; but a publishing-system interface might be unusably buggy or slow or have moronic authentication policies; all the Exerciser (let’s just say “the Ape” for short) does is perform a bunch of operations that a typical APP client might, and report the results. Also I’ve taken liberties in reporting some things that aren’t covered by the spec that implementors might want to know about. The rest of this fragment is only of interest to those obsessively interested in the Atom Protocol.How Can I Use It?I can’t send the code because I work for the world’s largest Open-Source publisher, which means that We Have A Process and I haven’t even started it. But the Ape is available via the Web.Unfortunately I’m not comfortable publishing the address just yet, because the current implementation of the Ape is on a simple CGI and implemented in JRuby, which has like an 8-second startup time, and I don’t want moronic robots pounding away at it.So if you want to use it, send me email and I’ll send the details.JRuby is getting faster and I’ll put it in a servlet pretty soon, then I’ll be comfy publishing the URI. I had good reasons for doing it JRuby rather than native Ruby, which I’ll take up in another fragment.How Can You Help?This has only been tested on two APP endpoints, so it’s likely that the next few users will be debugging the Ape at the same time as their own implementation. So if the Ape goes weird or is accusing you of a bug you don’t think you have, it’s likely not your problem; let me know.Now that I’ve got the basic framework down, it’s pretty easy to add tests. So please suggest APP tests.What Does It Do?The Ape has one required argument, the service document URI. Optionally, you can provide a username/password pair (only basic auth at the moment, see the To-Do list below), and the names of collections you want Ape to use for posting new entries and media files. Here’s what the Ape does:Retrieves the Service doc, verifies that it can be fetched and is served as application/atomserv+xml.Verifies that it’s well-formed.Validates it against the non-normative RNC schema from the protocol-09 Working Group draft.Lists the collections found in the service document, and the value of each one’s accept field.Finds a collection to use in posting test entries; if no name is provided, picks the first.Finds a collection that will accept image/jpeg postings; if no media-collection argument is provided, it picks the first available one that matches.Retrieves the entries collection, makes sure it’s served as application/atom+xml, that it’s well-formed, and that it validates against the non-normative Atom schema from RFC4287.Lists the entries currently found in the entries collection.Posts a new entry to the entries collection, and reports on the success of the POST operation and the entry’s server-assigned location.If the entry-creation POST sends back a body, checks whether its title, summary, and content are the same as that posted. The entry’s title is “From the &lt;APE&gt;”.Re-fetches the entries feed, verifies that the new entry’s ID shows up there, and that the version in the feed has the same title, summary, and content.Reports whether foreign markup (the posted entry has a dc:subject child) is preserved in the online version.Checks whether the online version has a link@[rel=edit] URI.PUTs a modified version of the entry to the edit URI.Re-fetches the entries feed to verify that the update is reflected in the entry.Deletes the entry and reports the success of the DELETE operation.Re-fetches the entries feed to check that the deleted entry is no longer there.To-DoPlease add to this section!Internationalization sanity-check; this was actually in an earlier version but fell by the wayside while chasing a JRuby bug, should be easy to add back in.Media resources and media link entries. Unfortunately, at the moment I don’t know a single available APP server that can handle media posts and isn’t hopelessly broken.Authentication options. Basic+TLS will be easy I think; haven’t started thinking about others.Try to change an entry ID with a PUT, and report the results.Release the source code so you can run this locally against your own engine without having to use my website.Improve the diagnostics. For example, the posted summary might differ from the one in the feed because there isn’t any in the feed, or because it’s been converted from whatever you sent to type="html".Pretty up the ugly web-site. Anyone know of an appealing royalty-free picture of an ape grooming another?Categories.</content>

      <content type="xhtml">You know, I’ve really had trouble figuring out Nick Carr. I’m a confirmed subscriber, because a lot of his writing is excellent; but then, some of it seems to come from troll territory. I have a theory; and some words on Open Source. [Update: Carr responds at length.]The Good and the BadHe regularly writes thoughtful, penetrating pieces, for example on the online ad market or Hypermediation or IT economics; carefully argued and thought-provoking even where I’m unconvinced.On the other hand, he also fires broadsides that feel at best half-baked, about how businesses shouldn’t allow blogging and Wikipedia is lame and Open Source isn’t about communities any more.The ExplanationI think I see a theme: Carr seems to be arguing that there’s nothing new in the world. Blogging? Let’s have some old-fashioned discipline. Wikipedia? Open Source? Conventional command and control, move right along, nothing new to see here. Obviously, I disagree: The steady migration of knowledge onto the Net is a new thing, qualitatively. And, in the last few years, the phenomenon of millions of people becoming contributors, not just consumers, is a big deal and I don’t think anyone really understands it.Open SourceAnyhow, the reason I started writing this was to push back on Carr’s recent Open Source as a metaphor, which builds from the observation that successful OSS projects attract financial support and have formal governance, proceeding to the familiar “Nothing really new here” conclusion. I think Carr’s problem is that he doesn’t actually see Open-Source people in their natural habitats; he was at OSBC but not OSCON. The practice of OSS software has two drivers that matter: the community of peers, and the urge to scratch a technical itch. If you don’t understand that, you’ll never understand anything important about OSS. I’ve been sitting in front of this excellent Ubuntu box for a week now, and I look at the digicam framework and chat client and text editor and package manager and photo editor and literally hundreds of other offerings that make this thing go, and I shake my head in wonder at the notion that anyone could see this as a product of Business As Usual.</content>

Take it out and set it aside.Chop the next ingredient while the pepper’s cooking, you have to interleave the chopping and frying.Take the meat out of the marinade (some will come with it, that’s OK) and stir-fry it. Set it aside; there’ll be a little marinade left in the wok.Add a little oil to the wok and stir-fry the onions until they’re getting soft.Toss in the rest of the chopped veggies on top of the onions, maybe a little more oil, stir-fry. Sprinkle liberally with teriyaki sauce.Add the meat and burned peppers back in for the last 60 seconds or so of frying.This sounds complicated but I don’t think setting up the marinade took Lauren more than 15 minutes and I know I had dinner on the table 20 minutes after I walked into the kitchen.ServingGoes well with Basmati rice and a low-malt high-hop beer in the Pilsener style.</content>

      <content type="xhtml">I’ve been having fun writing Ruby (and I’ll post some thoughts on that, and the code, soon) and one of the things I’m trying to do is be idiomatic. I haven’t fully internalized where to use parentheses and where not to; but I’ve come to appreciate the virtues of leaving them out; one of the reasons that Ruby’s so easy to read is that there are fewer typographic squiggles to break up the flow of meaningful text. Also, having done mostly Java for some time, I use lowerCamelCase method names. But after some days soaking in the Ruby ethos, those names are starting to feel reallyKindOfOverExcited and I’m warming to Ruby’s cool_measured_rhythms instead.</content>

We were worried about making it there for the opening session, and the wind was howling so I was worried about losing my hat, but there was a photo op. [Updates: an explanation and another photo.]You can see how it works; whatever it is that this thing processes gets stored in those big silo-like objects, then gets loaded into ships on the river. An agricultural product, I bet.People work, have offices I suppose, up above the silos there; see the windows and doors?[Update: Robert McCabe writes:]I worked in Grain Elevators in Toronto during the summers while at university. The structure on the left is the Head House where the grain is ‘elevated’ and weighed before being sent on conveyor belts to the silos. The area on top of the silos houses a network of conveyors that move the grain about at speeds in excess of 40 mph (grain has to be kept from becoming damp and compacted by moving it between silos every few days). The windows are needed to vent the conveyor area as the grain dust is kicked up by the conveyors and becomes explosive, a fuel-air explosion (dust from Soya beans is 45x more explosive than TNT). The loaders on the dock are on platforms so they reach the top of an empty ship.[Update: Brian Knowles sends a pointer to a picture of the other side.]</content>

      <content type="xhtml">Sometimes we make progress. Way last year, I got email from Norbert Lindenberg, grousing about the Terms of Use on Java.net; they were full of scary language about how you and your employer had to indemnify Sun and “its business partners” against anything bad that might happen with any connection to anything you did, and about how you were signing up for the similarly-scary sun.com terms of use. So I went poking around and asked the Java.net people why they sounded unfriendly, and they said, “Hmm, let’s talk to the lawyers”, who said, more or less, “If there are good business reasons to relax this a little, well OK then.” It turns out we’re partnering on this stuff with O’Reilly and CollabNet, so there were a lot of moving parts involved; a whole bunch of people had to pitch in. I didn’t do much of the work, so I may have this wrong, but from where I sit it looks like Marla Parker and and Cliff Allen deserve special credit. Anyhow, as of yesterday, things are better. Check it out: the new Java.net Website Terms of Use. Still not light reading, of course, but not likely to cause potential contributors any heartburn.</content>

      <content type="xhtml">Well, I was going to have to do it sometime. I got out the USB cable and plugged the camera into the Ubuntu box, not expecting much.What a pleasant surprise; some little program popped up, told me I’d plugged in a Canon S70 and wondered where I’d like to download the pictures to. Had a nice little slide-show thingie too for quick review. It doesn’t seem to preserve the names the camera gave the pictures; a pity. [Update: Hubert Figuiere, maintainer of gPhoto2, wrote to point me at the “Preserve Filenames” option right there in front of me. Gphoto seems excellent!]Then it was time to break out the Gimp.Shot through a car window, and it shows. Signs like this are common in Vancouver, and they point the way to a movie shoot. I assume they’re shooting a sequel to this.The Gimp. Well, I think I could learn to live with it, you know? I haven’t figured out how to resize a rectangular selection, but everything else I needed to do pretty well just worked. Sure is amazingly like PhotoShop, isn’t it? Except for I’ve been using Elements, not full PhotoShop, and Elements doesn’t have a Curves control, but the Gimp does, which is kind of nice. Levels and curves don’t preview in real-time, but that hurts less than you’d think. And if you’re wondering how much rotating you need to do, there’s a “Measure Distances and Angles” tool.And then there’s performance: the Gimp on a 2.6GHz Sun Ultra 20 stomps all over Elements on the PowerBook.</content>

      <content type="xhtml">Just a scratchpad for my further Ubuntu-experience notes. So far: “locate”, Emacs, Thunderbird, Firefox, function keys, windows vs. apps, menu placement, hibernate, and X keyboard mappings.The Sun keyboard I’m using on the Ultra 20 is good, but it’s got this little teeny “Alt” key that’s hard to reach, and this great big dorky “Diamond” key next to the space-bar, that I want to be Alt. Here is the appropriate xmodmap(1) invocation:keysym Super_L = Alt_L remove mod4 = Alt_LHibernate works solidly but looks shaky. On the way down, I get plaintive whines about “soft CPU lockup” problems, and on the way up, I get some serious screen derangement, plus an occasional complaint that “HAL hibernation failed”. OK, I prefer my hardware concrete anyhow.Three days in, it is so obvious that OS X menu placement (one menu space, the same position for all apps) is right, and all other options are wrong. I suppose Apple’s patented it?It’s only taken me a day or two to decide that the Windows/Gnome view that a window is a window is a window, and alt-tab works at a window at a time, and you don’t have to bear in mind the difference between an app an a window, is right, and OS X is wrong about this.Wow! I’d forgotten about locate(1); it’s here and it Just Works and boy, is it ever faster than Spotlight.Grmph. My mousewheel doesn’t work in Emacs. And you have to do some voodoo to get cut-&amp;-paste working:(setq x-select-enable-clipboard 't) Plus, it doesn’t have an icon in the taskbar. In fact, I’m beginning to think that Emacs is generally one of Ubuntu’s weaker links. [Update: Mark Pilgrim writes to point me at emacs-snapshot-gtk, which is a bit more polished, and ispell works.]Thunderbird’s spam filter is remarkably good these days, and learns fast. A couple of steps ahead of Mail.app, I’d say. Its search function is immensely less irritating, too (I fart in Spotlight’s general direction). Unfortunately, the Emacs keystrokes, which work more or less everywhere on OS X, aren’t there. [Update: Jay Carlson writes with pointer to a how-to.]Firefox doesn’t have a setting to go to your home page in a new tab. [Update: Richard Cohen points out that a middle-click on the “Home” icon does the job.]Working on a nice big desktop keyboard and not having to fight OS X for use of the function keys is a nice change.</content>

      <content type="xhtml">The W3C Technical Architecture Group, on which I had the honour to serve for a couple of years, is working on a document called URNs, Namespaces, and Registries. Norm Walsh, longtime TAG member, has written a human-readable version, and I recommend it. The question of how to name things is persistently one of the hardest in Computer Science, and one of the reasons the Web succeeds is that it does a pretty good job, using URIs. If you’re thinking “Doesn’t he really mean URL?”, check out The Universal Republic of Love). However, every so often a group of people says “Hey, URIs beginning with http: are addresses, not names, and we need names, persistent names, so we’ll invent a new URI scheme.” They are nearly always wrong; it takes a whole lot of thinking about the notions of names and addresses to achieve clarity, and wanting a new URI scheme is usually evidence that you haven’t. I’ve tried to explain this dozens of times, but I think Norm does a better job than I ever have.</content>

      <content type="xhtml">I should really not write about Lebanon, but I can’t stop. I’d like to draw your attention to Hizbullah attacks along Israel's northern border May 2000 - June 2006, a June 2006 document from Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who are presumably experts on the subject. Go read it yourself. I’d like to write some more on truce-breaking, on killing civilians and hiding among them, and about whom it’s appropriate to be angry at. If you don’t feel like reading what I have to say (and it’s not very cheerful), go have a look at the Ceasefire Now petition and consider signing it. [Update: Thank you world! I have a mailbox full of people saying things like “wanted to inject a positive note into what’s probably a flood of hate”; and not one warmonger. I’m truly moved, and who knows, maybe there’s hope.]Breaking the TruceThat Israeli document paints a picture of an armed truce that had been holding pretty well since May of 2000. The number of incidents was 2 in 2000, 2 in 2001, 2 in 2002, 4 in 2003, 3 in 2004, 5 in 2005, and one in 2006 before it all blew up. (Check out April 2005, when the Hez kidnapped two northern Israeli Arabs to shake them down for for intelligence; what lovable guys).Clearly somebody in Israel thinks the current situation is an improvement; Lebanon’s infrastructure ripped up, hundreds of civilians dead, hundreds of thousands of refugees in motion, and hundreds of Hez rockets over the border every day.Weirdly, Israel seems to prefer hereditary dictatorships to emerging democracies on their borders.This all seems insane to me, but draw your own conclusions.On Killing Civilians, and Hiding Among ThemI got an astounding amount of pushback on my it’s wrong to kill civilians post, all of it saying more or less exactly the same thing: “No, it’s sad-but-necessary to kill them because Hezbollah is hiding among them.” This point of view is not obviously insane; if an armed man were about to kill me and I couldn’t stop him without taking down an innocent bystander too, well, I just might do it. But let’s be reasonable, please: killing them by the hundreds to get dozens of your enemy is barbaric, pure and simple. And flattening whole suburbs in an unsuccessful attempt to kill enemy leaders is worse.That hiding-among-civilians issue has more nuance than you might think. In Salon, The "hiding among civilians" myth offers solid evidence that in fact Hezbollah does not do this down south where the fighting is hottest. On the other hand, there is evidence (albeit somewhat shaky) that Hez has been launching attacks from inside Christian villages. Which makes a kind of perverted sense, since those gangs are often blood enemies. Once again, draw your own conclusions.Once again: Military violence against civilians is wrong, and if you have an argument that convinces you it’s right, your argument is broken.Worthy of ContemptI’m having a persistent anger-management problem; seeing your former home blown to hell with malice aforethought will do that. So, who am I mad at? Oddly, I’m not that mad at the foot soldiers on either side, the IDF or the Hez. It’s depressingly easy to get young men to go out and kill and die for reasons that turn out later to have been really crappy. The IDF grunts’ leaders tell them that doing this will make the rockets stop and bring peace to Israel’s northern border, and I’m sure a lot of them are going about their bloody business as conscientiously as they possibly can. The Hez grunts are mostly poor, oppressed, ignorant, and religion-befuddled, and their leaders tell them that doing this will punish violent oppressors and do God’s will.Those leaders, though... anyone who’s read first-hand reportage about the Hez leadership knows they’re bloodthirsty racist fundamentalist barbarians who would really like to kill all the Jews and revert the world to fourteenth-century ways. Scum.As for the Israeli political leadership, we have to act on the assumption that they actually kind of understand what’s going on around them, and that they launched this in full knowledge that they intended to kill hundreds, displace hundreds of thousands, and break a country. And there’s a sickening suspicion that they knew it wouldn’t work, that this is all playing to the domestic political theater; which would be getting into Milošević territory. Scum.But right at the moment, there’s another group that I’m even angrier at. These are the individuals right here in the civilized world who are egging on one side or the other, who show up in blog comments and on talk radio and in some newspaper columns, explaining how it’s OK for one side to lob rockets into cities, or for the other to blow up towns with everyone in them, because the other side deserves what it’s getting; the victims are kind of sub-human, or are paying a fair price for something they did in 2001 or 1987 or 1973 or 1967 or 1949 or a couple of millennia before that.Their position, basically, is “Let’s you and him fight”. Yep, they’re willing to fight to the last screaming bleeding victim, as long as it’s a couple of continents away from their comfy chair. Some more of them will write me after I publish this. They’re not just scum, they’re cowards.</content>

He calls himself “Stiff” and his blog “Sztywny Blog”. Anyhow, he also heard back from Linus Torvalds, Dave Thomas, David Heinemeier Hansson, Steve Yegge, Peter Norvig, Guido van Rossum, and James Gosling.

Why aren’t we using it for Solaris updates? I managed to pull together the whole witches’ brew of OSS that makes ongoing go without ever leaving Synaptic. Oops, not quite true, I cruised past CPAN to get DBI and DBD::MySQL, but I’m not sure I needed to, because when I got MySQL, I saw a lot of perl-related stuff go flying by.The thing I was really scared of was getting all my Emacs customization pulled over, but that was pretty well 100% painless. Almost all my keybindings even worked.The BadThunderbird can’t see some of my IMAP folders on the Sun server. No idea why. [Update: Because I hadn’t “subscribed” to them. Why should I have to do this?]Some things are anti-aliased, but Emacs isn’t, and the jaggies are hurting my brain. So I’m using this monstrous 14-point Courier bold to help me ignore them.“Ispell” doesn’t work in Emacs; the Net is full of people asking about the dreaded “Ispell misalignment” message, but none of the answers worked. Blecch; I need a working spell-checker. [Update: Several people have written telling me to use aspell instead of ispell. I am; that’s the default on Ubuntu, and it’s broken. I think it may be related to me having everything in Unicode-by-default.]The MySQL Admin GUI is broken as shipped. I didn’t even know it existed, so I thought I’d spare myself the mental pain of remembering how to define users and databases and so on; but every time I selected the User Admin function, it just locked up.

      <content type="xhtml">I have a bunch of notes and thoughts scattered round my computer and brain and I was going to do a big round-up post, but who knows, something might turn out to be a conversation-starter, so I guess I’ll split ’em all up to keep things orderly. Before I get going on that, I just want to say “Thanks!” to the O’Reilly people for putting on this event. What with the new baby I could only stay for about 48 hours, but it felt like a 48-hour-long warm bath for the soul. Not only am I among my tribe, but the people are mostly friendly and mostly witty and quite a few of them are stylish in offbeat and interesting ways, and then a whole bunch of them have become friends over the years. The talks weren’t, on average, as good as the crowd, on average, but then some of them were excellent. Here’s a question: should OSCON become partly an UnConference or Camp or something? I’ve been to some of those and I really like them, but on the other hand, quite a few of the OSCON sessions amount to someone who Really Knows His-or-Her Shit standing on stage laying out what the next few steps are in some deeply important piece of the computing ecosystem. I mean, welcoming grass-roots voices is good, but if you want to know where Python is going, you need to listen to Guido, and if you want the bleeding edge on the Atom Protocol, along with a command-line demo, I’m your guy. Which is to say, information transfer from obsessives is a valid sub-function of tribal gatherings. Having said that, during this kind of session, the dialogue with the audience is organic and spontaneous and the questions are typically so good that there’s really no “authority” relationship between the person with at the front of the room with the microphone and a person in one of the chairs facing them. Still, I think OSCON would benefit from turning one of its days—or even half—into an UnConference. Stand by for more OSCON-driven fragments. [Update: Here’s a contrarian voice. I thought the paper selection was good, but he raises a troubling question: If I hadn’t already known dozens and dozens of attendees, how would I have gone about meeting them?]</content>

      <id>249@http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/</id>&lt;p&gt;In my "Spam Suspects" email folder today, I noticed some spam which used Google as a redirection service, by linking to http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.somespamsite.com. When trying this technique with &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.microsoft.com"&gt;some other site&lt;/a&gt;, I found that google responds to this query with a &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.3"&gt;302&lt;/a&gt; redirect to the site in question. Clearly, the spammer was using this system to lure people who trust Google into visiting their site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I don't understand is why Google needs a public redirect system like this that is so obviously open to abuse. The google.com/url?q=... page doesn't seem to accept anything but already fully specified urls, so the sole purpose of this page is to do redirects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason I can think of for them needing a service like this is if they serve up one in a thousand search-results pages with redirect links, in order to log what people actually click on. If this were the case though, why not at least check the referrer to see if the user actually came from a google.com page? Am I missing something here?&lt;/p&gt;<category term="Miscellaneous"/>2006-05-05T21:13:41-05:0014http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/2006/05/05-249.html#comments</entry>

      <id>247@http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/</id>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.siliconvalleysleuth.com/2006/03/digg_is_used_fo.html"&gt;Silicon Valley Sleuth&lt;/a&gt; reported this morning how several stories about Google buying Sun suspiciously made it to the front page of &lt;a href="http://www.digg.com"&gt;Digg.com&lt;/a&gt;. These "baseless rumours" were all submitted and promoted by a small group of Digg members that seemed to be working together.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I found this story through &lt;a href="http://www.digg.com/technology/Digg_is_used_for_Sun_stock_manipulation"&gt;Digg itself&lt;/a&gt;, where it was posted on the front page. It later mysteriously disappeared from Digg though, and a &lt;a href="http://www.digg.com/search?search=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconvalleysleuth.com%2F2006%2F03%2Fdigg_is_used_fo.html&amp;submit=Search&amp;area=all&amp;type=both&amp;age=60&amp;search-buried=on"&gt;URL search&lt;/a&gt; indicated that the story was since marked as "buried".
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://diggtheblog.blogspot.com/2006/02/small-update.html"&gt;The Digg Blog&lt;/a&gt; says the following about this burying feature:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Digg now allows logged in users to bury stories as 'inaccurate'. Once enough people bury the story, it is removed from the queue and the following banner is displayed at the top:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4139/1647/400/warning.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No banner is displayed though, which makes me wonder if it was buried because enough people marked it as inaccurate (the same people who were promoting these Google+Sun stories maybe?) or whether an admin removed it in an effort to hide how easily Digg can be manipulated. There's currently an update on Silicon Valley Sleuth stating that it seems unlikely the Digg system was actually manipulated in this case, but this update wasn't there when the story was buried, and also doesn't make the theoretical possibility of this happening any less likely.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Due to the automated nature of Digg (which uses user-votes to determine how prominently to display a story) it certainly seems possible for a group of people to get together and promote stories in order to get them onto the coveted front page, while at the same time burying stories they don't like. Worse than that, what would stop someone from automating this process and creating a couple hundred accounts for this purpose? To reduce suspicion, these accounts could digg random stories from time to time, or even undigg stories once they've made it to the front page.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If this is not going on already, I predict it will soon. Compared to the trouble BlogSpammers are going through in order to game sites like Google, DayPop or Blogdex, gaming Digg seems relatively easy. While Digg claims to &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/blogspotting/archives/2006/03/digg_argues_it.html"&gt;have ways to prevent manipulation&lt;/a&gt;, one can't help but wonder whether it's enough, and I'm sure there are plenty of spammers out there just dying to beat the system...

So this week, we're introducing a general-purpose tool-building factory factory factory, so that all of your different tool factory factories can be produced by a single, unified factory. The factory factory factory will produce only the tool factory factories that you actually need, and each of those factory factories will produce a single factory based on your custom tool specifications. The final set of tools that emerge from this process will be the ideal tools for your particular project.

A great read that not only shows why I too hate most frameworks, but also over-engineered code in general. YAGNI FTW! (via &lt;a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2006/03/08/19865.aspx"&gt;Don Box&lt;/a&gt;)

      <summary>Why are political extremists so interested in UFOs? The Nation of Islam has its ?Great Mother Wheels.? Their melanin-challenged brethren in the Neo-Nazi movement have the myth of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Swabia#Nazi_mythology"&gt;Neu Schwabenland&lt;/a&gt;, an Antarctic redoubt where the remnants of the Third Reich fled after the war, with the U.S. military in hot pursuit. There, hidden among the ice and the Emperor Penguins, the frostbitten Aryans plotted to reconquer the world. To that end, they created a fleet of UFOs, using top-secret Nazi technology that They don?t want you to know about. Nizkor has recreated &lt;a href="http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/z/zundel-ernst/flying-saucers/"&gt;pamphlets published by the Holocaust denier Ernst Zundel &lt;/a&gt;on this topic, one of which includes a &lt;a href="http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/z/zundel-ernst/flying-saucers/ufo-investigator-pass.html"&gt;helpful list of German phrases to be used during an encounter of the Third Kind. &lt;/a&gt; (This myth is also covered in the eighth chapter of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0814731554/metafilter-20/ref=nosim/"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;.)</summary>

      <summary>&lt;a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/8/prweb424020.htm"&gt;An experiment recently performed&lt;/a&gt; by the AET RaDAL group shows that the gravitomagnetic field produced by a rapidly-spinning superconductor can cause a 1.117 times increase over the Earth's gravity. &lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2004/19apr_gravitomagnetism.htm"&gt;Gravitomagnetism&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon predicted by General Relativity, is a poorly understood but promising topic in modern physics. Speculation about harnessing the bizarre, space-warping and gravity-altering effects of gravitomagnetism has already begun. &lt;a href="http://www.hpcc-space.de/publications/documents/aiaa2004-3700-a4.pdf"&gt;Reactionless space propulsion [PDF]&lt;/a&gt; is the most apparent use (&lt;a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/48144"&gt;previously discussed&lt;/a&gt;), with the potential applications far-reaching and nearly inconcievable. &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/GSP/SEM0L6OVGJE_0.html"&gt;The earlier experiment by the European Space Agency&lt;/a&gt; involving another rapidly-spinning superconductor earlier this year found a massive increase in strength over the predicted values, but still miniscule by our standards. Things could become very interesting if the results from this latest experiment pan out.&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

      <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.dashes.com/anil/">&lt;p&gt;Slate takes a &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2147278/"&gt;spoiler-filled look&lt;/a&gt; at Will Ferrell's &lt;em&gt;Talladega Nights&lt;/em&gt;. We enjoyed the movie, and it's consistently funny, but the thing that really struck me as unusual about the movie was its assumption of intelligence on the part of the audience. Many parts of the setup were fast-forwarded through, with the presumption that we didn't need the love interest or backstory spoon-fed to us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With these kinds of dumb comedies, it's usually the practice to crawl through a tired series of expository scenes, and I was really struck by how willing the moviemakers were to skip through the preliminaries. And of course, (&lt;a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2003/12/29/spoilers_ahead_"&gt;spoiler queens&lt;/a&gt;, beware!) any film that ends with two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASCAR &lt;/span&gt;champions in an extended liplock has my vote. I'm pretty sure that was the pitch: "Give me $100 million -- I'm making a movie about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASCAR &lt;/span&gt;guys kissing."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;map name="google_ad_map_gRxOPHWaGs89Ue9NkBQLF9bKKbE_"&gt;&lt;area shape="rect" href="http://imageads.googleadservices.com/pagead/imgclick/gRxOPHWaGs89Ue9NkBQLF9bKKbE_?pos=0" coords="1,2,367,28"/&gt;&lt;area shape="rect" href="http://services.google.com/feedback/abg" coords="384,10,453,23"/&gt;&lt;/map&gt;&lt;img usemap="#google_ad_map_gRxOPHWaGs89Ue9NkBQLF9bKKbE_" border="0" src="http://imageads.googleadservices.com/pagead/ads?format=468x30_aff_img&amp;client=ca-pub-0956928739115480&amp;channel=5797611664&amp;output=png&amp;cuid=gRxOPHWaGs89Ue9NkBQLF9bKKbE_&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashes.com%2Fanil%2F2006%2F08%2F16%2Ftalladega_night"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/AnilDash?a=Y5FGoe"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/AnilDash?i=Y5FGoe" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?a=MStxI6d9"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?i=MStxI6d9" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?a=8sCSU45K"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?i=8sCSU45K" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?a=winCByuN"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?i=winCByuN" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AnilDash/~4/13433073"/&gt;</content>http://api.feedburner.com/awareness/1.0/GetItemData?uri=AnilDash&amp;itemurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashes.com%2Fanil%2F2006%2F08%2F16%2Ftalladega_nighthttp://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/08/16/talladega_night</entry>

      <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.dashes.com/anil/">&lt;p&gt;Way back long ago, when the Internet was still in black-and-white, I read &lt;a href="http://www.jwz.org/fire/"&gt;Jamie Zawinski's report&lt;/a&gt; of a fire in a tire warehouse across the street from where he lives. I was in New York then, and had never really spent any time in San Francisco as an adult, so I had no real idea of the geography of the city. I kind of shrugged my shoulders, marveled at the first person report being online so quickly, and went back to my web surfing. To give you an idea of what things were like in that simpler time, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JWZ'&lt;/span&gt;s photos of the event were actually captured &lt;em&gt;on film&lt;/em&gt;, not on a digital camera.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, the Six Apart office where I work in San Francisco is across the street from the location where that warehouse fire took place. Reading the &lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1997/12/27/MN56112.DTL"&gt;news reports from the time&lt;/a&gt; reveals what a radically different neighborhood it is today from nine years ago. Perhaps the best demonstration of this change is the photo I took with my camera yesterday of the new building that's risen in the same location.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://anil.vox.com/library/post/palms.html" style="text-decoration : none; text-align : center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://a3.vox.com/6a00b8ea067a51dece00c22521dc738e1d-320pi" width="320" height="240" alt="The Palms" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the &lt;a href="http://anil.vox.com/library/post/palms.html"&gt;bemusement of my Vox neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;, I think it's a really fascinating transformation. Obviously, neither tire warehouses nor "&lt;a href="http://www.ubayp.com/buildings/555-4th-Palms.html"&gt;custom Studio Becker cabinetry&lt;/a&gt;" are really my aesthetic, but that idea of rebirth and reinvention is what makes cities and communities so intriguing to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don't think I would have guessed nine years ago that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JWZ &lt;/span&gt;would live a block from my office (we still haven't met), &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; would live a block from this office, and across the street, that same location where all those tires burned would inspire &lt;a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2006/03/27/newscolumn6.html"&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; describing frenzied condominium sales. "[T]he 300-unit Palms at 555 Fourth St. is logging similarly dazzling numbers."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;map name="google_ad_map_W9GVQGtcw0hDmdSCbCKvzX.DBzc_"&gt;&lt;area shape="rect" href="http://imageads.googleadservices.com/pagead/imgclick/W9GVQGtcw0hDmdSCbCKvzX.DBzc_?pos=0" coords="1,2,367,28"/&gt;&lt;area shape="rect" href="http://services.google.com/feedback/abg" coords="384,10,453,23"/&gt;&lt;/map&gt;&lt;img usemap="#google_ad_map_W9GVQGtcw0hDmdSCbCKvzX.DBzc_" border="0" src="http://imageads.googleadservices.com/pagead/ads?format=468x30_aff_img&amp;client=ca-pub-0956928739115480&amp;channel=5797611664&amp;output=png&amp;cuid=W9GVQGtcw0hDmdSCbCKvzX.DBzc_&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashes.com%2Fanil%2F2006%2F08%2F11%2Fthe_palms_are_n"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/AnilDash?a=drZMwc"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/AnilDash?i=drZMwc" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?a=l6f34n6a"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?i=l6f34n6a" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?a=r9gmnkK4"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?i=r9gmnkK4" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?a=ne7JlZc2"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?i=ne7JlZc2" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AnilDash/~4/11412158"/&gt;</content>http://api.feedburner.com/awareness/1.0/GetItemData?uri=AnilDash&amp;itemurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashes.com%2Fanil%2F2006%2F08%2F11%2Fthe_palms_are_nhttp://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/08/11/the_palms_are_n</entry>

The closest thing is Rebecca Blood's &lt;a href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/handbook/index.html"&gt;Weblog Handbook&lt;/a&gt;, which is the best blog book ever written, even at four years old.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want a more bloggish example of how to be a better blogger, though, you can't do better than her series of interviews about &lt;a href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/index.html#bloggerson"&gt;Bloggers on Blogging&lt;/a&gt;. The list includes several of the greatest bloggers of all time, especially since Rebecca's one of the greatest herself and asks appropriately insightful questions. Interviewees include Matt Haughey, Jessamyn West, Heather Armstrong, Rashmi Sinha, Glenn Reynolds, Adam Greenfield, David Weinberger, Megan Reardon, Fred First,and most recently Jason Kottke. Jason illustrates the strength of the interview questions well, if you compare his recent "&lt;a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/08/how-i-blog"&gt;How I Blog&lt;/a&gt;" post to &lt;a href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/bloggerson/jasonkottke.html"&gt;Rebecca's interview&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jason's self-descriptions are useful but brief, but his responses in Rebecca's interview, while equally considered and thoughtful, sound more like the real &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt; I'm friends with. Part of it is the difference in tone that Jason has on his own site, but I think part of it is the intelligence and thoughtfulness of the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;map name="google_ad_map_JWhAPaQem4vHiiKSBNfmlkb38ng_"&gt;&lt;area shape="rect" href="http://imageads.googleadservices.com/pagead/imgclick/JWhAPaQem4vHiiKSBNfmlkb38ng_?pos=0" coords="1,2,367,28"/&gt;&lt;area shape="rect" href="http://services.google.com/feedback/abg" coords="384,10,453,23"/&gt;&lt;/map&gt;&lt;img usemap="#google_ad_map_JWhAPaQem4vHiiKSBNfmlkb38ng_" border="0" src="http://imageads.googleadservices.com/pagead/ads?format=468x30_aff_img&amp;client=ca-pub-0956928739115480&amp;channel=5797611664&amp;output=png&amp;cuid=JWhAPaQem4vHiiKSBNfmlkb38ng_&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashes.com%2Fanil%2F2006%2F08%2F09%2Flearning_from_t"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/AnilDash?a=7YsmUR"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/AnilDash?i=7YsmUR" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?a=B3zwA0jO"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?i=B3zwA0jO" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?a=FE4RAcAd"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?i=FE4RAcAd" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?a=SKNTyetC"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?i=SKNTyetC" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AnilDash/~4/10651821"/&gt;</content>http://api.feedburner.com/awareness/1.0/GetItemData?uri=AnilDash&amp;itemurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashes.com%2Fanil%2F2006%2F08%2F09%2Flearning_from_thttp://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/08/09/learning_from_t</entry>

      <content type="html" xml:lang="en" xml:base="http://www.dashes.com/anil/">&lt;p&gt;Ned Lamont was undoubtedly helped by his supporters' web efforts in his defeat of Joe Lieberman in yesterday's primary. Lieberman's team was especially incompetent for having a $15 hosting plan that couldn't keep up with his web traffic, and then u&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2147396/"&gt;nfairly blaming the downtime&lt;/a&gt; on malicious users who were presumably Lamont supporters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But. What's frustrating is that the enthusiasm of a tiny group of Lamont's supporters also acted as another demonstration of the ugliness of a mob mentality online. &lt;a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B6434DE99%2D40DC%2D4D2A%2DA1AC%2D3336AEB3C692%7D&amp;amp;siteid=mktw&amp;amp;dist="&gt;Jon Friedman had a recent MarketWatch story&lt;/a&gt; which wasn't about the Lamont/Lieberman race, but articulated the challenge quite eloquently:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics can showcase their opinions, too -- within reason. And this is where it gets tricky for a critic, especially, bloggers. Plenty of bloggers have opinions and no reluctance about voicing them, which is fine. A big benefit of the Internet is it allows individuals to feel empowered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I contend that too many bloggers hurt themselves. They come across as loudmouths looking for an argument or a way to exploit the relative celebrity of their subjects. It's kind of pathetic when writers can't find something original to say and have to resort to criticizing someone else just to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lanny Davis picked up the same idea, but he had the misfortune to be a direct target of the vitriol. From &lt;a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110008763"&gt;the Wall Street Journal's opinion page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[T]he issue is not just emotional outbursts by these usually anonymous bloggers. A friend of mine just returned from Connecticut, where he had spoken on several occasions on behalf of Joe Lieberman. He happens to be a liberal antiwar Democrat, just as I am. He is also a lawyer. He told me that within a day of a Lamont event--where he asked the candidate some critical questions--some of his clients were blitzed with emails attacking him and threatening boycotts of their products if they did not drop him as their attorney. He has actually decided not to return to Connecticut for the primary today; he is fearful for his physical safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This illustrates two of the worst traits of a lot of the blogs I follow. First, many of us are far too willing to criticize those who are actually largely in agreement with us. It's as if the opponent isn't the person who disagrees with me 100%, but rather the person who agrees with me 99%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second, and even more egregious, problem is that everyone who wades into trying to communicate on a broad scale with the blogosphere will face one of these large-scale vitriolic attacks at some point. It may be a small percentage of the total number of people who read an item, but it's hard to describe how unpleasant it can be to get hundreds of angry or threatening messages, even if they only represent a small part of your total audience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cost of these sorts of attacks is that people won't distinguish a few bad actors from bloggers and online communities in general. Instead, they'll say, "Those bloggers are crazy!" and retreat from engaging the medium entirely. It'll be years until they come back and try again. I'd urge any community that wants to influence or inspire a movement to consider what techniques it wants to use for policing its most extremist members, as well as what tactics it wants to use for encouraging the accountability that makes for more productive conversations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other posts on this topic, which I'm semi-obsessed with:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/06/27/learning_from_e"&gt;Learning From Experience&lt;/a&gt;, from two years ago.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/10/11/an_unkind_commu"&gt;An Unkind Community&lt;/a&gt; from later that year&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/05/31/yhbt_hand_20"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YHBT HAND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 2.0, which stands for "You Have Been Trolled, Have a Nice Day", and was about an oddly undeserved pile-on where tech bloggers flamed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;O'R&lt;/span&gt;eilly about trying to protect the name "Web 2.0" for its conference.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, we've seen this behavior in tech blogs, and in politics, so perhaps we'll see these kinds of group beatdowns coming to music blogs, knitting blogs, and food blogs, instead of the minor flamewars that they've had so far. Then I can add it to &lt;a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/03/21/the_blog_cycle"&gt;The Blog Cycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;map name="google_ad_map_iAV5K5top0rEokcRh1FITD1pFUg_"&gt;&lt;area shape="rect" href="http://imageads.googleadservices.com/pagead/imgclick/iAV5K5top0rEokcRh1FITD1pFUg_?pos=0" coords="1,2,367,28"/&gt;&lt;area shape="rect" href="http://services.google.com/feedback/abg" coords="384,10,453,23"/&gt;&lt;/map&gt;&lt;img usemap="#google_ad_map_iAV5K5top0rEokcRh1FITD1pFUg_" border="0" src="http://imageads.googleadservices.com/pagead/ads?format=468x30_aff_img&amp;client=ca-pub-0956928739115480&amp;channel=5797611664&amp;output=png&amp;cuid=iAV5K5top0rEokcRh1FITD1pFUg_&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashes.com%2Fanil%2F2006%2F08%2F09%2Fwinning_at_what"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/AnilDash?a=5PgVNQ"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/AnilDash?i=5PgVNQ" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?a=qGiyGzke"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?i=qGiyGzke" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?a=bCEY3qWw"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?i=bCEY3qWw" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?a=5aFCarWt"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/AnilDash?i=5aFCarWt" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AnilDash/~4/10554358"/&gt;</content>http://api.feedburner.com/awareness/1.0/GetItemData?uri=AnilDash&amp;itemurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashes.com%2Fanil%2F2006%2F08%2F09%2Fwinning_at_whathttp://www.dashes.com/anil/2006/08/09/winning_at_what</entry>

It’s from Philip Roth, talking about his newfound lack of care about readership numbers Five thousand people is a lot of people. And, as a friend of mine said about five thousand readers, “If they came through your living room one at a time, they’d leave you in tears.”</summary>http://www.benhammersley.com/Ben/Blog/B53F904D-08A8-4F0C-A5D7-E8CA1F361575.html</entry>

This is him waiting as he was being introduced. After the powerpoint, we had cocktails. Later than night, a tornado passed over Manhattan, and, sheltering in a deli, a Rasta told me it was Jah being his retribution down on Babylon.

This is terribly inconvenient, with deadlines and proper enjoyment of the footy getting in each others’ way. So while I did get to see the England dear-god-someone-score-or-shoot-me-now match this week, complete with comedy Italian pronunciation of Crowwwwchhh and Aaaaaaaaashlycol. I entirely missed the Argentina-Serbia masterpiece. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjRO10rxjMs"&gt;This goal, for example, being the sort of thing I shouldn’t have missed for the sake of emptying my inbox.&lt;/a&gt; Curses. (And while we’re on the subject, dare anyone consider the tabloid madness that might happen if England were to face Argentina in a World Cup final in Germany? The symbolism is so dense, The Sun’s sub-editors might implode.) Still, did you see the Italy-USA match? I mean...wtf? If it’s all going to be like that, I’m going back to my email.

It’s a wonderful conference - despite having had me back to speak three times now - and always a joy. For a tech conference, it’s remarkably untechy: I’m talking on “How to be a Renaissance Man,” but as I’ve been given the keynote slot of fun/doom - 8pm between the beers and the DJ - expect lots of knob gags and references to the more profane influences on the life of Raphael. Looking at the programme the striking thing is the amount of old tech people running as fast as they can from the digital to the tangible, and from the solo to the social. I know many people in the online world who yearn to make things with their fingers, to be cooks or gardeners or painters or carpenters, and who are rejecting the web2.0 rehash of 1999 as ultimately tiresome and meaningless. Maybe I’m old and jaded, but there’s got to something more beautiful than yet another blog or social network.

The trend (as I&amp;rsquo;ve written about recently) is to make the control areas at the top and bottoms of windows dark, to contrast better with the content area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So NetNewsWire&amp;rsquo;s status bar went from the glass look to a darker gradient. I think it fits in better with the unified title-and-toolbar window style. (I could have made it even darker, but then it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have fit with the window style.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But... will we get new or changed window styles at WWDC? Will we see a new convention for status bars? I don&amp;rsquo;t know! There&amp;rsquo;s an excellent chance that what we&amp;rsquo;ll see this week will affect the look of NetNewsWire and lots of other apps.</summary>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3345<id>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3345</id>

      <title>The new Combined View and hybrid web/desktop apps</title>
      <link>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3344</link>
      <summary>The new Combined View&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to call it a bug fix rather than a new feature. The performance bug (and some sizing bugs) couldn&amp;rsquo;t be fixed with the old version. This was a case where only a complete re-write would fix the problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To re-iterate... the problem was that each item had its own separate webview, which meant tons of overhead. If you had 100 news items displayed, that was literally the same as having 100 small web pages open all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So the obvious choice was to make it one big webview&amp;mdash;a single web page&amp;mdash;to get rid of that overhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But then there&amp;rsquo;s a whole other challenge: how do you make it so that you can still navigate with the keyboard? How do you have the concept of a selected item? It can&amp;rsquo;t just be the same as an online reader&amp;mdash;it needs to have the features desktop app users expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The key to the whole thing is JavaScript. When something happens in the page&amp;mdash;you click on a news item, for instance&amp;mdash;the page calls back into the app, and the app tells the page how to update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like Ajax in that way, except that the communication channel is not http and it&amp;rsquo;s synchronous (which it &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be, since it&amp;rsquo;s right there on your machine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Similarly, if you choose a menu item or click a toolbar button (such as Mark All As Read), then the app calls into the page to run some JavaScript. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to generate a new page&amp;mdash;it just changes some classes, swaps some images, whatever it needs to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve found that being able to do this two-way communication&amp;mdash;page-to-app and app-to-page&amp;mdash;allows for all kinds of clever stuff. You can add some nice touches. For instance, check out these two details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src="http://inessential.com/images/cvSelected.png" width="142" height="133" alt="Combined View selected screenshot" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src="http://inessential.com/images/cvInactive.png" width="140" height="131" alt="Combined View selected screenshot" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the first detail, the Combined View has focus. In the second, the subscriptions list has focus. (The Combined View also dims when the app is no longer frontmost.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To get the dimming effect, the app calls into the page to tell it it&amp;rsquo;s inactive. The page then uses JavaScript to swap some CSS classes, which changes the display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Anyway, I liked working this way enough (getting to exercise my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS chops) that I also did the same thing for the new Attention Reports feature. (Lifted straight from FeedDemon, by the way.) Those are also HTML pages&amp;mdash;but with rollovers and all that. And when you click an unsubscribe button, it calls into the app, and the app displays the standard unsubscribe sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is all definitely a benefit of WebKit&amp;mdash;it makes possible this kind of hybrid, a mix of desktop and web technologies. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve only scratched the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; PS In the screenshot above, how did I get the rounded corners in the current selection? CSS, plus four little graphics for the round corners. I&amp;rsquo;m not drawing on top of a webview or anything nutty like that&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s pure CSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; PPS The old Combined View&amp;mdash;one item gets one webview&amp;mdash;sounds bizarre. Why would I have done that in the first place? Well, the Combined View actually came before WebKit. Originally, each item was a separate NSTextView&amp;mdash;recall that NSTextView had (probably still has) some basic HTML display. This was much, much faster than using WebKit webviews, mainly because the HTML feature in NSTextView was so very basic. Once WebKit came out, the natural thing was to switch from NSTextViews to WebViews. That&amp;rsquo;s how it ended up being the way it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; PPPS I&amp;rsquo;m partitioning the hard drive on my laptop and re-installing OS X so I have a place to install Leopard (assuming we get Leopard disks at WWDC). Hence all the writing tonight. ;)</summary>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3344<id>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3344</id>

      <title>NetNewsWire 3.0d7: Super Early Sneak Peak</title>
      <link>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3343</link>
      <summary>I want to try something a little different&amp;mdash;I want to work on NetNewsWire 3.0 a bit more out in the open than I usually do. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;wise&lt;/i&gt;, exactly&amp;mdash;but it&amp;rsquo;s more fun for me. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So I put up a super-early sneak peak release. It&amp;rsquo;s not a beta, it&amp;rsquo;s not even an alpha, it&amp;rsquo;s at 3.0d7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You can &lt;a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/beta.php"&gt;download it here&lt;/a&gt;. (But I warn you with big red letters that it&amp;rsquo;s a work in progress, and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try it out if you&amp;rsquo;re not comfortable with it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The big new thing&amp;mdash;the thing I&amp;rsquo;m personally excited about&amp;mdash;is the brand-new, totally rewritten Combined View.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The old Combined View (like a newspaper or river-of-news view, for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know) had some performance issues because every single news item was a separate webview. If you had 100 items, that was like 100 mini-web-pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The new version uses just one webview&amp;mdash;but, even though it&amp;rsquo;s a single web page, you can still navigate with the space bar and arrow keys, you can still expand and collapse. It still has the concept of a selected item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (Or you can just scroll and point-and-click. It works with both styles of reading.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href="http://inessential.com/images/nnw3newcv.png"&gt;screen shot of the new Combined View&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s another &lt;a href="http://inessential.com/images/nnw3newcv2.png"&gt;screen shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As I say, it&amp;rsquo;s a work in progress, and feedback (especially on the new Combined View) is definitely welcome. There will be a bunch of other new features and lots of bug fixes. (If you were hoping to see ____, and it&amp;rsquo;s not there, consider that it&amp;rsquo;s still early in the process. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean ____ is not on the list.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also&amp;mdash;NetNewsWire 3.0 will be a free upgrade.</summary>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3343<id>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3343</id>

      <title>When will Leopard ship?</title>
      <link>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3341</link>
      <summary>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wondering when Leopard will ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My guess is that it&amp;rsquo;s farther along than you might think and that it will ship in October or November of this year. (If I had to pick a day, I&amp;rsquo;d guess October 27.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The main thing is to get it out there before Vista, which is scheduled (still?) for January. So, if it&amp;rsquo;s going out before January, might as well get it out before Christmas, no?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Recall too that the timescale would be a bit like Panther&amp;rsquo;s: there was WWDC in the summer and then a release in late October. So there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be anything unprecedented about an autumn release. Also recall that last year&amp;rsquo;s WWDC was all about Tiger, even though Tiger was already released&amp;mdash;which means Leopard has been under construction for a while.</summary>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3341<id>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3341</id>

      <title>New developer technologies?</title>
      <link>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3338</link>
      <summary>I wonder if there will be new developer technologies at this WWDC as important as Cocoa Bindings and Core Data in recent years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t think so&amp;mdash;which doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother me at all, actually. I do expect new technologies, and I expect improvements to Bindings and Core Data, but I don&amp;rsquo;t expect big new fundamental technologies like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My reasoning is pretty simple. Cocoa apps are generally built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Back in the early days of OS X we already had View technologies, but not much for Model and Controller. Then Cocoa Bindings came along, which covered the Controller part. A year later Core Data appeared, which covered the Model (data) part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So we&amp;rsquo;re covered (M, V, and C) and I don&amp;rsquo;t expect fundamental new developer technologies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But of course I stand ready to be surprised by things I didn&amp;rsquo;t think of!</summary>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3338<id>http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3338</id>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Still looking to cut costs, struggling server maker Sun Microsystems has sold off its mainframe re-hosting business to Chicago's Clerity Solutions Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;skey=mainframe_servers;pkey=platforms;skey=server_hardware;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;skey=mainframe_servers;pkey=platforms;skey=server_hardware;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"On June 30, 2006 Clerity acquired the intellectual property assets and hired Sun employees directly involved in the mainframe hosting solution business," Clerity said in a statement slated to be released on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sun's re-hosting business, part of its Mainframe Migration offerings, was set up to help customers move their mainframe applications over to Sun's Unix-based hardware. To date, the group has done more than 1,200 re-hosting implementations, according to Sun's Web site.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sun had written two major mainframe programs to run on its Solaris version of Unix, both of which have now been acquired by Clerity, the company said. These two programs are the called Mainframe Transaction Processing (MTP) and Mainframe Batch Manager (MBM).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clerity did not say how many Sun employees it had hired or how much it paid for the business. Sun could not be reached immediately for comment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sun &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/05/31/78807_HNsunlayoffs_1.html"&gt;is in the middle of a major restructuring&lt;/a&gt; designed to save as much as $590 million annually. The plan, which was implemented by Sun Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Schwartz soon after he took over the company last April, is expected to claim as many as 5,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sun has rarely been profitable since its server business was decimated by the dot-com implosion six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - San Francisco - &lt;a href="http://www.activegrid.com/" class="regularArticleU"&gt;ActiveGrid&lt;/a&gt;, which calls itself the "Enterprise Web 2.0 company," is moving its tooling over to the Eclipse open source environment and will join the Eclipse Foundation as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=application_development;skey=developer_tools;skey=open_source_developer_tools;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=application_development;skey=developer_tools;skey=open_source_developer_tools;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the company's tooling will support Eclipse by the end of the year, said Peter Yared, ActiveGrid founder and CEO, during an interview at the &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/reports/SRlinuxworldsf06.html" class="regularArticleU"&gt;LinuxWorld conference&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. The company also will join Eclipse later this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ActiveGrid has focused on development of applications on the LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL Perl/Python,PHP) stack and on grid computing. The company says it adds enterprise-ready tooling, SOA, and security features to the stack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM's backing of PHP helped sway ActiveGrid into the Eclipse camp, Yared said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Well, when we started ActiveGrid and LAMP, Eclipse didn't support scripting languages. But now after IBM's support of PHP, [Eclipse is] supporting scripting languages really well," Yared said. "So now, Eclipse has become LAMP-friendly if you will, so we're going to jump ahead of that parade, right? We don't like doing code editors and things like that."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yared explained the company's linking of Web 2.0 and grid computing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The big thing about Web 2.0 is its ability to scale on large clusters of commodity machines and that’s the grid aspect of this technology. So now you can build rich apps but scale them horizontally," Yared said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company has not yet determined which level of Eclipse membership it will seek. Chief membership levels include Strategic Members, which view Eclipse as strategic; Add-in Provider members, which view Eclipse as an important part of their strategy, and Associate Members, which is for non-profit organizations, standards bodies, universities and other similar members participating in development of the Eclipse ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEE ALSO:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/04/08/HNactivegrid_1.html"&gt;ActiveGrid lights LAMP, grid with Java-less app server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP) posted better-than-expected financial results Wednesday that were buoyed by strong growth in the company's PC group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=hardware;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Excluding certain charges, HP reported a profit of $1.7 billion or $0.52 per share on revenue of $21.9 billion for its fiscal third quarter, ended July 31. Analysts had been expecting earnings per share of $0.47 on revenue of $21.8 billion according to Thomson Financial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company's Personal Systems Group saw revenue grow 8 percent, year over year, with notebook sales jumping 14 percent and desktop PC sales up 5 percent. Operating profit for the group was up too, totalling $275 million for the quarter. Last year the group's profit was $163 million for the same period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HP's results -- considered a bellwether for the industry -- come during a slowdown in PC sales growth and earnings warnings from companies such as Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Dell Inc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dell, which is due to announce results on Thursday, has warned of lower profits for its most recent quarter because of "aggressive pricing and slow commercial sales worldwide."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Worldwide, PC sales grew by 9.7 percent year-over-year during the second quarter of 2006, a slowdown from 12.9 percent growth in the first three months of the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HP's other main lines of business did not fare as well as the Personal Systems Group. Revenue in the company's enterprise servers and storage business was up only 3 percent, thanks in part to declines in HP's PA-RISC and Alpha systems businesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company's printer business grew by 5 percent but was hurt by a 3 percent slowdown in consumer hardware sales, HP said. Overall, the group remained highly profitable, however, earning $884 million on $6.2 billion in revenue&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HP's Services revenue was up 1 percent year-over-year, totalling $3.9 billion, and software revenue was up 30 percent, totaling $318 million for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

The MOU expires Sept. 30, and the DOC has not taken action on it, a DOC spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Internet users from outside the U.S., including members of the United Nation's Working Group on Internet Governance, have criticized the MOU, saying the relationship puts ICANN under control of the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, the DOC has simply extended the contract for ICANN to manage the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions until 2011. The contract extends ICANN's management of Internet Protocol address space allocation, protocol identifier assignment, the generic and country-code top-level domain name systems, and root server system functions, ICANN said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nonprofit ICANN has managed those functions since 2000 under a contract with the U.S. government. The new contract consists of a series of one-year options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In February, the DOC issued a request for information on whether other entities were qualified to manage the IANA functions. The department concluded ICANN was "uniquely qualified to perform the technical functions that are critical to the security and stability of the Internet," the DOC said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Rocky road for mobile Linux</title>
      <link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/16/HNlinuxworldsf06mobilelinux_1.html</link>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Linux has great potential in the mobile arena, but establishing it there will be a tall order, industry participants told a &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/reports/SRlinuxworldsf06.html"&gt;LinuxWorld Conference and Expo&lt;/a&gt; audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=mobile_applications;pkey=wireless;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=mobile_applications;pkey=wireless;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mobile phone users will have to demand the technology, and they are more interested in cool devices and applications than in a software platform for its own sake, said Greg Franklin, a venture capitalist at Intellect Partners, in Palo Alto, California, who helps Finnish carrier TeliaSonera AB find investment candidates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Franklin participated in a panel discussion Tuesday that was envisioned originally as a chance for mobile operators to talk about Linux as a component of their products and services. But it emerged as a conversation about the operators' venture capital funding for mobile Linux startups. When organizers approached the carriers about participating, that's the aspect they wanted to talk about, according to John Ellis, director of carrier market development at Motorola Inc., who moderated the panel. Executives seeking startup innovations for T-Mobile International AG &amp; Co. KG, France Telecom SA and Swisscom AG also were on the panel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That may be a good indication of where most mobile operators stand on mobile Linux. They value its flexibility and are interested in new technologies, panelists said, but there is less going on in the trenches of actual device and service rollout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A multimillion-dollar marketing push like Intel Corp.'s Centrino campaign for Wi-Fi could help drive demand, Intellect Partners' Franklin said. But most mobile operators and handset vendors are too focused on promoting their own brands to push Linux that way, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;T-Venture of America Inc., T-Mobile's investment arm in Foster City, California, isn't looking to any particular technology or OS but rather at products and services that T-Mobile's customers will want, said Claas Heise, its managing director. It's a tough job to get funding from the group, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I see ... quite a few companies coming with Linux-based solutions or applications to our doors," Heise said. However, they tend to be point solutions such as personal information managers. Only bigger things, namely applications and services that can generate additional revenue from a large part of T-Mobile's customer base, really grab the carrier's product managers, he said. Tools that could ease customer support are another area of interest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"With niche applications, I don't really get a good response ... which I need in order to be able to do an investment," Heise said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Motorola's own venture group looks at about 3,000 potential investments per year for its fund of about US$100 million, according to Harshul Sanghi, an investment manager at Motorola Ventures. It only actually makes 25 to 30 investments, he said. The company is looking for fresh ideas at all layers of the communications stack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It's still very early days in the adoption of Linux on the handset, and I think there's still a lot of problems that need to be solved," Sanghi said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Franklin described his ideal scenario for mobile innovation: A startup invents something that's valuable to mobile subscribers, a venture team gets a service provider interested in it, together they translate it and present it to a large enterprise customer, and the new technology goes into trial there and eventually into commercial deployment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being able to build good partnerships is critical for this, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This is going to be the new competitive advantage in the wireless marketplace," Franklin said.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>JBoss making SOA play with BPEL, ESB</title>
      <link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/16/HNjbosssoared_1.html</link>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Raising its profile in the SOA space, JBoss is readying upgrades to its jBPM (Java Business Process Management) software to support the 1.1 and 2.0 versions of BPEL (Business Process Execution Language). The open source software vendor also released a beta version of its ESB (enterprise service) bus this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=service-oriented_architecture_-_soa;pkey=web_services;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=service-oriented_architecture_-_soa;pkey=web_services;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JBPM is a platform for workflow, business process management, and process orchestration. BPM is critical to SOA because SOA is all about integrating business processes and publishing services, said Pierre Fricke, JBoss director of product management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also supporting jPDL (Java Process Definition Language), jBPM has become a popular item, according to Fricke. "JBPM download rates have tripled in the past year. We're now north of 20,000 downloads per month," Fricke said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Up until jBPM was available, the Java programmer that wanted to do workflow, that wanted to do BPM-type of work within a Java program, had to buy very expensive packages," he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BPEL 1.1 will be added to jBPM in September, with BPEL 2.0 due sometime afterward. The 2.0 version is expected to become the OASIS-approved version of the specification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The spec's being finalized right now," and will feature improved process constructs, Fricke said. JBoss is participating in development at BPEL at OASIS, he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"BPEL will be more flexible and more extensible," Fricke said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BPEL support and release of an ESB are vital to JBoss, said analyst Shawn Willett of Current Analysis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It's extremely important if they are to have any credibility as an enabler of an SOA. Just having an application server is not enough," Willett said in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"They need an infrastructure to make services practical in a corporate environment. JBoss is also falling behind others in the open source world, as Apache now has ServiceMix, and of course Sun is moving to open-source its ESB. So they needed to act. Adding BPEL support is a no-brainer but was complicated by the fact that the BPM engine they purchased did not originally natively support BPEL. So they had to go back and retrofit it," Willett said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JBoss's beta release of JBoss ESB serves as a prelude to a final version due later this year. Acting as the glue for enterprises to deploy an SOA, the ESB hosts and integrates services and processes. The ESB beta release is downloadable &lt;a href="http://labs.jboss.com/portal/jbossesb/downloads" class="regularArticleU"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JBoss parent company Red Hat, meanwhile, plans in a few weeks to offer a beta version of release 5 of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. "The big driver behind that OS platform is that we've integrated virtualization capabilities," enabling multiple OS instances to be run on a single piece of hardware, said Brian Stevens, vice president of engineering and CTO at Red Hat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red Hat and JBoss officials were interviewed by &lt;i&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/i&gt; on Wednesday at a hotel near the LinuxWorld conference in San Francisco. Although the two companies might seem like a natural fit for such a show, they are not exhibiting at it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JBoss has not exhibited in the past and continues with this stance, according to a company representative. Red Hat has released a statement that the company prefers more direct contact with the open source community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Red Hat values our long-standing and vibrant collaboration with the open source community. As a company, we have found that more direct methods of communication and engagement beyond LinuxWorld, including seminars, Red Hat Summit, and other focused events, help us to maintain and grow our interactions with our customers and the Linux community," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Yahoo plugs Web mail security hole </title>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Yahoo Inc. has fixed a security vulnerability in its Yahoo Mail service that could have allowed malicious hackers to hijack accounts and harm users in a variety of ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;pkey=security;pkey=web_services;skey=web_services_security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;pkey=security;pkey=web_services;skey=web_services_security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We have developed a fix for this bug and have deployed it worldwide. Yahoo Mail users will not be required to take any action to be protected from this exploit," said Kelley Podboy, a Yahoo spokeswoman, via e-mail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nir Goldshlager and Roni Bachar from &lt;a href="http://www.avnet.co.il/"&gt;Avnet&lt;/a&gt;, a computer security company based in Israel, discovered the vulnerability in early August.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem was Yahoo Mail's handling of attachments. By creating an HTML attachment with different encoding schemes, one could have bypassed Yahoo Mail's security filter and executed malicious JavaScript code, Bachar said via e-mail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The exploit allowed the JavaScript code to be executed as soon as a recipient opened the e-mail message, even if the recipient didn't open the attachment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was also possible to steal the recipient's Yahoo Mail cookie, hijack the session and gain access to the person's in-box. "This attack vector could be used to launch a variety of other more sophisticated attacks," Bachar wrote. These could include unleashing worms, installing keylogger programs, phishing and scanning ports on the PC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After identifying the vulnerability, Bachar and Goldshlager immediately alerted Yahoo, so that the vendor could patch its system. Bachar isn't aware of any known exploits of the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Smart card vendors talk privacy</title>
      <link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/16/HNsmartcardcoalition_1.html</link>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - A group of smart card and smart chip vendors are launching a campaign to talk up the security and privacy features of their products, even as researchers raise questions about their use in passports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=data_management;skey=privacy_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=data_management;skey=privacy_management;pkey=security;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smart card makers Gemalto NV and Oberthur Card Systems, as well as chip makers Infineon Technologies AG, Philips Semiconductors and Texas Instruments Inc., on Wednesday launched the Secure ID Coalition to promote the use of secure smart card standards as a way to protect privacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group, debuting at the National Conference of State Legislators this week, was formed because the message about the security features of contactless smart cards is "not getting through very clearly," said Tres Wiley, director of e-documents for Texas Instruments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, at the Black Hat conference in Las Vegas, German security researcher Lukas Grunwald demonstrated a way to copy information from his passport's RFID (radio frequency identification) chip to another smart card. And as the U.S. Department of State geared up this month to start issuing passports with smart cards included, Bruce Schneier, chief technology officer of Counterpane Internet Security Inc., predicted the new passports could eventually be hacked and allow for surreptitious tracking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But members of the SecureID Coalition said some security concerns are overblown. Even if a thief was able to copy the information on a passport's smart card, he wouldn't be able to change it because the information will be encrypted, they said. The encrypted photograph on the smart card wouldn't match the thief's face if he tried to use it to cross a border, they noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Adding a chip to a document ... really ties the user to the document, especially when it's used in conjunction with biometrics," said Neville Pattinson, director of marketing and government affairs for Gemalto.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another goal of the coalition is to educate policymakers about the difference between smart cards and traditional RFID chips. Traditional RFID chips, often used to tag products as they move through a supply chain, are designed to be scanned easily and quickly, while smart card vendors have paid more attention to security and privacy, Wiley said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"RFID was traditionally done to tag things, pallets, cartons, domesticated animals," he said. "It was the layering of security on top of that RF pipe that really made it appropriate for an identity application."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SecureID Coalition members have endorsed a set of privacy rights, including the consumer's right to be confident that ID documents have been appropriately secured; and the consumer's right to know what data is contained in electronic ID documents, how that data will be collected and transmitted, and when and why the RF device is being read,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the state legislator conference, SecureID Coalition members will attempt to "demystify" smart card technology, Pattinson said. The group will talk to lawmakers about efforts in some states to slow the use of smart card technology in identification documents, he said.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>EBay to test changes to search results pages</title>
      <link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/16/HNebaytestschanges_1.html</link>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - EBay plans to begin testing later this month a redesign of its search results pages that will contain more information for each listed item and will sport a new look and layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=b-to-c;pkey=business;pkey=data_management;skey=enterprise_search;skey=internet_applications;skey=search_engines;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=applications;skey=b-to-c;pkey=business;pkey=data_management;skey=enterprise_search;skey=internet_applications;skey=search_engines;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The online marketplace hopes that the changes will enhance the shopping experience for buyers, wrote Nico Posner, a senior product manager, in an official announcement posted Tuesday on eBay's Web site.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, search results will be bigger and price information will be highlighted with larger type and a new color. Each listing will have a button so buyers can save it to a "watch list." Most listings will also have a link labeled "see quick details" that, if hovered over or clicked on, will show information like shipping and handling charges and accepted payment methods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A small percentage of randomly selected buyers will begin seeing the new search results pages later this month. EBay will reveal its plans for a wider rollout of this new design once the testing period ends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, eBay announced its intention to test &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/07/21/HNebayprotection_1.html"&gt;new search functionality&lt;/a&gt; it called Magellan. "Finding is incredibly important on eBay. The more effective we can make finding, the higher the [sales] conversion rates and the more robust the marketplace is for buyers and sellers," said President and Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman in July of last year regarding Magellan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In May of this year, eBay struck a &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/05/25/78674_HNyahooebaypartner_1.html"&gt;wide-ranging partnership with Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;, which in part calls for the companies to collaborate on search technology and advertising.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It isn't clear whether the new redesign of the search results page is related to the Magellan effort and to the Yahoo partnership. EBay didn't immediately reply to a request seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The partnership with Yahoo was widely seen as a defensive move by both vendors against common rival Google. Google is using its leadership position in search to expand into the Web portal space, which is Yahoo's core territory, and into the product listings and online payment market, eBay's stomping ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EBay is also fighting internal demons. Last month, eBay executives said during a conference call that core marketplace revenue and gross merchandise volume should have grown more in the second quarter, ended June 30.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They blamed an imbalance between eBay's traditional product listings, which include both auction and fixed priced products, and store inventory listings, which on average now make up 83 percent of active marketplace listings. To correct the imbalance, eBay is marketing traditional product listings more aggressively and raising store listing fees, never a popular move with sellers.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Vonage E911 availability nears 85 percent</title>
      <link>http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/redirect?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/16/HNe911availability_1.html</link>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/?source=rss"&gt;InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt;) - Vonage Holdings has implemented enhanced 911 emergency dialing service on nearly 85 percent of its customers' lines, but the company says it continues to have problems in areas served by AT&amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="right"&gt;&lt;a href="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=networking;pkey=telecom;skey=voip;skey=media_networking;ord=123456789?" target="_blank" /&gt;&lt;img src="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/idg.us.info.rss/news;pos=imu;tile=6;sz=336x280;pkey=networking;pkey=telecom;skey=voip;skey=media_networking;ord=123456789?" width="336" height="280" border="0" alt="" align="right"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vonage is the largest U.S. provider of residential VOIP (voice over Internet Protocol) service. Vonage's E911 adoption is up from 26 percent at the end of November 2005, when a U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/12/06/HNvoipmiss911_1.html"&gt;deadline passed for VOIP providers&lt;/a&gt; to offer E911 to their customers. That month, the &lt;a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/techwatch/archives/004135.html"&gt;FCC backed off an earlier requirement&lt;/a&gt; that VOIP providers cut off customers who could not receive E911. With E911, emergency dispatchers can see the address where the 911 call originated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vonage is working hard to get the remaining 15-plus percent of its customers access to E911, said Steve Seitz, the company's vice president of 911 regulatory affairs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Slow E911 implementation in areas served by AT&amp;T local phone service -- large parts of the U.S. Midwest and Southwest -- is largely keeping Vonage from delivering E911 to about 95 percent of its customers, Seitz said. In AT&amp;T territory, about 63 percent of Vonage customers have access to E911, while 90-plus percent of Vonage customers in territories served by Verizon Communications and Qwest Communications International have E911, Seitz said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We think it's going to be an uphill battle to get that [AT&amp;T] percentage on par with the other carriers," Seitz said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A "hodgepodge" of issues remain in AT&amp;T territory, Seitz said. "Our goal is not to get into a tussle with AT&amp;T," he added. "Our goal is for every Vonage customer to have E911."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a July 28 filing with the FCC, Vonage accused AT&amp;T of not giving dispatch centers -- known as public safety answering points or PSAPs -- the connections needed to implement E911 for Vonage. AT&amp;T has been slow in some states to allow PSAPs access to its database linking phone numbers to locations, and it has delayed PSAP access to some telephone network routers, Vonage said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;T disputed Vonage's complaints, calling them "vague." Robert Quinn, AT&amp;T's vice president of federal regulatory affairs, points the finger back at Vonage, saying the company's continued decision to allow customers to choose new phone numbers with nonlocal area codes causes complications. PSAPs must upgrade their technology to allow wireless phones to transmit location-based information, and those upgrades are up to local governments, not AT&amp;T, Quinn said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some VOIP providers have promoted out-of-area-code phone numbers as a way for customers to cut long-distance calling costs to relatives or friends living in another part of the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The biggest issue is some [Vonage customers] have an Austin, Texas, phone number when they live in Virginia," Quinn said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some PSAPs in AT&amp;T's territory are slow to adopt the wireless E911 capabilities, Quinn said. In Oklahoma, about 1 percent of PSAPs have the wireless capability, while Massachusetts, in Verizon territory, has 100 percent of its PSAPs moved to the wireless technology, AT&amp;T said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The process of connecting VOIP customers to E911 is complicated, Quinn said. AT&amp;T's own VOIP service provided E911 to 85 percent of its customers as of mid-July. But Quinn pointed back to Vonage's out-of-area-code number transfers as a likely problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Don't point the finger at me because of the marketing decisions they've made," he said. "I challenge them to tell us what it is that they think we're supposed to be doing for them."&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

Many gathered Wednesday at Digital Hollywood 2006 in San Jose, Calif., to hear the pros talk about the future of media online. Many feel that the television and movie studios will increasingly move to the online market. One such member, Brian E. Taptich, the vice president of business development at BitTorrent, talks with CNET News.com's Neha Tiwari about how his company is leading the trend in the industry. What's the future for online video sharing? Will studios and the online community live in copyright harmony? &lt;br clear="all" /&gt;</summary>

(He won't say what network, but it's probably either HBO or Showtime.) He did it for the money. &lt;P&gt; With the clock winding down on the languid days of late summer, this week brings us one of the oddest and most challenging releases of the season, Refn's &lt;a target="new" href="http://www.magpictures.com/profile.aspx?id=21a5d9cf-7b7d-4765-9bc2-eb7918042695"&gt;"Pusher" trilogy,&lt;/a&gt; three violent, low-budget films shot on the streets of Copenhagen, Denmark, with hand-held cameras and actors recruited from that city's criminal underworld. That's right, Copenhagen. Instead of the tidy citadel of liberal tolerance and nanny-state social democracy, Refn gives us a nightmarish city of callous killers, drug deals gone wrong, Slovenian and Turkish crime bosses, and skanky hookers who dump babies on the floor at all-night parties where they snort coke till their sinuses bleed. &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.salon.com/~r/salon/index/~4/13636278"/&gt;</summary>http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2006/08/17/btm/index.html?source=rss</entry>

"The Dodgers were in last place, seven games out." &lt;p&gt;They'd also lost eight straight and 13 out of 14. In less than three weeks since then, all they've done -- as Scully would say -- is win 17 out of 18, including the last six in a row, and now they lead the National League West by three and a half games over the Arizona Diamondbacks and San Diego Padres. &lt;p&gt;It's the best run for the franchise since 1899, and isn't that amazing?

      <title>The Fix: Andy Dick goes on licking and groping spree. Jerry Springer joins cast of "Dancing With the Stars." Plus: Celebrity ping-pong!</title>

Apparently visibly drunk for the duration of the show, Dick started licking comic Patton Oswalt's face after Oswalt joked about Dick's cameo in Jessica Simpson's "Public Affair" video (in which Dick licks Simpson's roller skates). Dick went on to turn his tongue on Farrah Fawcett, Carrie Fisher and Nichelle Nichols (who played Uhura on "Star Trek") during the taping. But he really let loose at the after-party, taking a piss in front of New York Post reporter Mandy Stadtmiller, then offering her cocaine, then trying to grope her and finally biting her hand. Asked by Stadtmiller why he started with the licking, Dick responded: "I was doing it because I was desperately trying to tie the show together like a fisherman with tuna, and you're a little piece of fresh tuna. But thanks for asking. Do you want me to lick your face now?"

      <summary>As a podcaster (&lt;a href="http://www.mos.org/cst"&gt;work show&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.bostonbehindthescenes.com"&gt;home show&lt;/a&gt;), I love the podcast support in iTunes and on the iPod. However, I've always felt that one feature was seriously broken: The option to "Update only unplayed episodes" on the iPod. This feature doesn't work right because iTunes doesn't properly keep track of whether or not a podcast has been played. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In iTunes and on the iPod, a podcast is marked as played if you have listened to any of it at all. This means that if you listen to the first 30 minutes of a 60-minute show, pause it, then listening to something else before finishing the first show, iTunes will consider the first show played and remove it from your iPod on the next synchronization. Not only does this mean you must listen to shows in their entirety between synchronizations, it also almost completely negates a great feature of the iPod: the ability to resume listening to a podcast at the point... &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?a=P0dLsi"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?i=P0dLsi" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~r/macosxhints/recent/~4/13391354"/&gt;</summary>http://www.macosxhints.com/trackback.php?id=20060814173901437http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060814173901437</entry>

To create the file, I just issued the command &lt;tt&gt;touch .metadata_never_index&lt;/tt&gt; from Terminal (make sure you're at the top-level of the volume, obviously). This worked for my FAT32 volume; an NTFS partition may require a different solution. Here are the things that did &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; work for me: &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Spotlight preferences: adding to Privacy list does not work for FAT32 volumes (or NTFS volumes).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;tt&gt;mdutil -i off /path/to/volume/&lt;/tt&gt;: Seems... &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?a=KzhTGe"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?i=KzhTGe" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~r/macosxhints/recent/~4/13391355"/&gt;</summary>http://www.macosxhints.com/trackback.php?id=20060814124808745http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060814124808745</entry>

      <summary>&lt;img src="http://www.macosxhints.com/images/tigerx2a.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 10px"&gt;In Microsoft Office v.X (not sure on 2004), .pps (PowerPoint Show) files are not associated with PowerPoint by default. And even if they were, I want to have the power to edit, not just show. So here's a quick way to rename lots of .pps files to .ppt (which lets you edit them in PowerPoint) using Automator: &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Open Automator, and create a new workflow, if one is not opened for you.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Insert the Get Selected Finder Items action (in the Finder Library) into your workflow.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Insert the Rename Finder Items Action (Finder Library). It will ask you, "This action changes the name of Finder items passed into it. Would you like to add a Copy Finder Items action so that the copies are changed and your originals are preserved?" This is a matter of opinion. I prefer to leave this out, so the files can be changed without having to re-copy them, and we aren't doing anything here t... &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?a=QmAQQz"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?i=QmAQQz" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~r/macosxhints/recent/~4/13391356"/&gt;</summary>http://www.macosxhints.com/trackback.php?id=20060814155810523http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060814155810523</entry>

      <summary>Ever have a problem with a CD/DVD stuck in your offline MacBook Pro and it doesn't allow you to boot up OS X? Apple mentioned the solution is to press and hold the trackpad button when booting your MBP. You tried that, but still fails? Another possible fix is the credit card/knife trick that sometimes works, but it just sounds not right? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; OK, now there is an easy way to do it: Just power up your MBP and leave it alone for about 10 minutes. It will eventually boot up and the CD/DVD will automatically eject (make sure your power cable is plugged in, though!). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; [&lt;b&gt;robg adds:&lt;/b&gt; I haven't heard about this possible fix before ... and I can't confirm it, not having a CD stuck in my MB at the moment.] &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?a=qBpt24"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?i=qBpt24" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~r/macosxhints/recent/~4/13391357"/&gt;</summary>http://www.macosxhints.com/trackback.php?id=20060814211608242http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060814211608242</entry>

      <summary>I discovered that if you are downloading or uploading zillions of files using the &lt;a href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/"&gt;Transmit&lt;/a&gt; FTP client, you can greatly accelerate the file transfer. How? While downloading/uploading, open the Transfers tab in its Preferences, and start messing with the &lt;em&gt;Maximum queue connections&lt;/em&gt; box. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Try to change this field to 400 then back to 200, then to 300 and then to 350. You will see, while you are messing with this field, that transfers start to accelerate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Apparently, changing one time isn't enough. The more you change, the more it accelerates. But as far as I tried this, the limit appears to be four to five changes (in my machine) using values not over 400. Changing it too much, or using high values, can saturate the Mac OS' web connection socket and you will (probably) end up without a web connection and will have to restart the machine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; [&lt;b&gt;robg adds:&lt;/b&gt; I tried this with a folder of 256 test documents, and ... &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?a=tglDnC"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?i=tglDnC" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~r/macosxhints/recent/~4/13391359"/&gt;</summary>http://www.macosxhints.com/trackback.php?id=2006081422552247http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2006081422552247</entry>

      <summary>I have created an AppleScript which will append a random quote to the bottom of your signature in Microsoft Entourage 2004. You can get the script &lt;a href="http://scriptbuilders.net/files/rhquotemenowsignature0.1.html"&gt;from scriptbuilders.net&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/dlfiles/RH_QuoteMeNowSignature.scpt"&gt;macosxhints mirror&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To use this script, you need to do a little configuration in Entourage. First create a signature called QuoteMeNowBase.In this signature you can place any normal signature you like. Make sure you leave a blank line after the signature so the quotes don't run into your signature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then create an empty signature called &lt;em&gt;QuoteMeNowSig&lt;/em&gt;. In your account settings, configure your signature to be the &lt;em&gt;QuoteMeNowSig&lt;/em&gt; signature. Then create a schedule to rotate the quote. For instance, if you wanted to rotate your quote every minute, create a schedule that runs this script every minute. To rotate every hour or day, make that ... &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?a=vc01kx"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?i=vc01kx" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~r/macosxhints/recent/~4/12941516"/&gt;</summary>http://www.macosxhints.com/trackback.php?id=20060811165325982http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060811165325982</entry>

      <summary>Here's a little Applescript that I've polished up for release: &lt;a href="http://www.bigbucketblog.com/2006/08/14/movie-splitter-3gp/"&gt;Movie Splitter 3GP&lt;/a&gt;. It uses QuickTime Player to slice up any movie into equally-sized chunks, and exports those chunks as 3GP. I wrote this when I discovered that my phone (the Motorola V3i) seems to have a hard time keeping video and sound in sync for more than 20 minutes, and I intended to use it to watch an entire movie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It's quite straightforward to use; open the movie you want to export and click on the script. It will ask how long you want the slices to be, and uses the most recent export settings. So just be sure to check them before you take it for a test drive. Enjoy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; [&lt;b&gt;robg adds:&lt;/b&gt; Here's a direct download link to a mirrored copy on macosxhints.com: &lt;a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/dlfiles/Movie Splitter 3GP.scpt"&gt;16KB download&lt;/a&gt;.

      <summary>I was googling around for this and came up empty handed, so maybe I can save somebody else some time ... I wanted to set the machine clock of a PowerBook G3, and didn't want to go through the hassle of booting to a usable system so I could use System Preferences. Also, I was unsure of whether or not my machine was saving the real time clock between reboots, so I needed a way to set the clock after powering on, but before booting into OS X.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reboot your machine, and hold Command-Option-O-F during the boot process to access the Open Firmware prompt. Most likely, the real time clock is aliased in OF as &lt;tt&gt;rtc&lt;/tt&gt;, so the command is this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;decimal dev rtc &lt;i&gt;sec min hour day month year&lt;/i&gt; set-time&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So to set the clock to 10 seconds past 11:15PM on December 31st, 2005, the command would be:&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;decimal dev rtc 10 15 23 31 12 2005 set-time&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;The Open Firmware prompt should type &lt;tt&gt;ok&lt;/tt&gt; after this, and you can then boot the Mac by typing ... &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?a=7ZHA7n"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?i=7ZHA7n" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~r/macosxhints/recent/~4/12941537"/&gt;</summary>http://www.macosxhints.com/trackback.php?id=20060814075952448http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060814075952448</entry>

      <summary>I don't know about anyone else, but I have a lot of shows and movies in &lt;tt&gt;.avi&lt;/tt&gt; format, and I like to keep them in my Movies folder for FrontRow access. When my hard drive fills up, however, I usually burn these to data DVDs, so as to fit as much as possible onto one disc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is that Front Row will not recognize the &lt;tt&gt;.avi&lt;/tt&gt; files burned to the data DVD if you select DVD from the menu, because it isn't a formatted DVD. So, as a workaround, I dragged the DVD icon from the desktop into my Movies folder. This created an alias that could be accessed from the videos menu in Front Row. And better yet, the alias stays as a placeholder even when the disc is ejected, so the next time you insert it, you are ready to go! &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?a=v7iT2m"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?i=v7iT2m" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~r/macosxhints/recent/~4/12941539"/&gt;</summary>http://www.macosxhints.com/trackback.php?id=2006081410565126http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2006081410565126</entry>

Realizing this in mid-click, I kept the mouse button held down, and moved the pointer off the close button. Upon releasing the mouse, the window did not close. This also works for the minimize and zoom buttons, and as far as I can tell it also works for any OS X window. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Granted, you have to have quick reflexes to realize your mistake in mid-mouseclick, but I thought I'd share nonetheless. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; [&lt;b&gt;robg adds:&lt;/b&gt; I was going to reply to the submitter that this was standard OS X behavior and not really hintable, but then I though about the number of users who are new to the platform who may not know about this.

Now click on the Audio button, and drag any protected song from the song list onto the audio portion of the timeline. iMovie will then proceed to convert the song for use in the project. After iMovie has finished converting the song, click on the Photos button and drag a photo onto the movie portion of the timeline. (As of version 5.0, iMovie requires some sort of visuals to be present before exporting the project. Earlier versions did not have this requirement.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; After the photo finishes rendering, go to the File menu and click on Share.

      <summary>In iPhoto 6.0.4, when you attach a digital camera and see the import screen, press the Return key on your keyboard twice in succession. iPhoto will switch to editing mode, showing all pictures that reside on the digital camera. You cannot make changes to the pictures, nor can you drag the pictures individually to your iPhoto library, but you can see everything on the camera.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;b&gt;robg adds:&lt;/b&gt; Wow. Not only did this work, but with my camera at least (Canon PowerShot SD400), I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; able to drag individual photos from the top portion of the Editing window into my Library. The only issue I had was that the date on the roll containing the dragged photos was incorrect (it came out as 12/31/00), but this is easily changed. I'm not sure if the drag-and-import capability varies by camera or not; please post the results of your efforts, including the camera model, and we'll get a sense for how widespread this may be.] &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?a=04QvO5"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?i=04QvO5" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~r/macosxhints/recent/~4/11324698"/&gt;</summary>http://www.macosxhints.com/trackback.php?id=20060811032250907http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060811032250907</entry>

      <summary>To quickly open an &lt;tt&gt;ssh&lt;/tt&gt; connection from nearly anywhere on your Mac, do the following: &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Open TextEdit and type in your connection string in the form of: &lt;tt&gt;ssh://user@host.com&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Select the whole line and drag and drop it on the Desktop. The result will be a &lt;tt&gt;*.inetloc&lt;/tt&gt; file.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Move the file to any folder you like. I made one named &lt;tt&gt;~/connections&lt;/tt&gt; that holds all of my &lt;tt&gt;*.inetloc&lt;/tt&gt; files. You can rename this file to whatever you like, and even change its icon.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Now you can drag and drop the &lt;tt&gt;*.inetloc&lt;/tt&gt; file to the Dock, the Finder's Sidebar or Tool bar, or to anywhere else. (It can even be selected with Spotlight)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If you use LaunchBar, open the Launchbar Configuration screen (Command-Y) and add another rule for your connections folder. Now your SSH connections can be opened with LaunchBar. I believe you can do similar with LaunchBar and Quicksilver, enabling quick launching of your SSH shortcuts.&lt;/li&gt; ... &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?a=4MiyL3"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~a/macosxhints/recent?i=4MiyL3" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macosxhints.com/~r/macosxhints/recent/~4/11324699"/&gt;</summary>http://www.macosxhints.com/trackback.php?id=20060810042411590http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060810042411590</entry>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve just started the second book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067973709X/pgreenspun-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mating&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by Norman Rush, which won the National Book Award.  Rush is an old guy who hasn&amp;#8217;t written that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disturbingly, if the best novelists are only allowed one book every decade or two, what does that say about the quality to be expected from a Weblog?

The Lebanese/Israeli conflict of recent weeks has caught my attention, however. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that it is the first time in more than 1000 years that a non-governmental group of non-Jews has attacked a group of Jews and suffered in any way. For more than 1000 years in Europe and the Arab world, mob violence against Jews was a harmless diversion, at least for the Christians and Muslims. Oftentimes, the non-Jews would profit handsomely from their efforts, at least in the short run, by being able to occupy houses vacated by Jews, taking Jewish property, and confiscating Jewish bank accounts. The closest that non-Jews ever came to suffering any negative consequence from &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom"&gt;a pogrom&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht"&gt;Kristallnacht &lt;/a&gt;in Germany, November 9, 1938. The Christian Germans on the rampage had a lot of fun, but the Christian-owned insurance companies afterwards complained that they would have to pay for the thousands of shops destroyed. Fortunately, the German government ordered the Jews themselves to pay for the damage.  (A &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375509240/pgreenspun-20"&gt;recent book on Jews who survived Auschwitz but were killed by their Polish neighbors&lt;/a&gt; upon returning home shows that even after WWII there were essentially no negative consequences for mob violence by European Christians against Jews.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might argue that the Palestinians have suffered for their attacks on Jews, but they never did suffer significantly for the mob violence that they inflicted on Jews before 1948. Any suffering of the Palestinians since 1948 has been primarily due to their being caught in the middle of a pan-Arab war that they had little part in starting. The Syrian, Jordanian, and Egyptian armies have also had difficulties at the hands of the Israelis, but these were professional soldiers sent by their governments and the average citizens of Amman, Cairo, or Damascus have not been displaced from their homes at any time during the 60-year war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lebanon 2006 offers a completely different experience of Jew-hatred and violence against Jews. A substantial subset of Lebanese citizens decides that they would like to kill Jews and that therefore it would be fun to launch some rockets into the residential neighborhoods of Israel. They expect to enjoy this activity for many months or years. Most of what they&amp;#8217;ve read about Jews in school and in newspapers comes from old educational materials translated from the German. Jews are weak. Jews operate in secret committees behind the scenes. Certainly if they have studied history they&amp;#8217;ve learned that when a Muslim mob attacks a community of Jews, it is invariably the Jews who end up having to flee &lt;a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/iraqijews.html"&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. Tehran, or &lt;a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/morocjews.html"&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt; or wherever, leaving their homes and property behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened this time? The Jews, armed to the teeth, came over to where the rockets were being fired and made the place unlivable. The Lebanese who thought they would be sitting in their living rooms watching Jews die on their television sets were forced to flee to the north or to Cyprus. This is a truly unprecedented situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Of course, many Lebanese who never fired a rocket are suffering the consequences of their fellow citizens&amp;#8217; actions, but military conflict hasn&amp;#8217;t gotten a whole lot more precise since King George III observed to Parliament on October 27, 1775, that he was &amp;#8220;anxious to prevent, if it had been possible, the effusion of the blood of my subjects; and the calamities which are inseparable from a state of war&amp;#8221;]

He is selling a fairly new, but out of warranty, convertible Ferrari on behalf of a customer.  He drove said Ferrari to Hanscom Air Force Base, the airport where we do our flying, a few weeks ago.  After we landed, he tried to move the power seat backward.  It wouldn&amp;#8217;t budge.  He drove the car back to his dealership with his knees against his chest.  The other day I asked him if he&amp;#8217;d sold the Ferrari.  &amp;#8220;I didn&amp;#8217;t get it back from the shop yet; they are still fixing the seat.&amp;#8221;  The problem turned out to be a broken switch, the kind of thing that the standard automakers buy in China for $1 and that seldom fails.  How much did Ferrari charge for a replacement switch?  $2200.  With labor, it was $5000 to fix the &amp;#8220;seat is stuck&amp;#8221; problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh and I flew the Cirrus down to Teterboro, NJ today to pick up a friend.  We told him the story.  He said &amp;#8220;Oh yeah, my old business partner Will spend $300,000 on a new Ferrari 360.  It had a fancy pushbutton F1 transmission.  You had to press a button to go into reverse, but the button was always failing and he would have to take it back to the dealership over and over again.&amp;#8221;

That way they have to work, but they don&amp;#8217;t have to work a repulsive yuppie job to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle.  The main objection to this approach is that it is tax-inefficient.  If the kid earns $50,000 per year doing something he finds rewarding and you give him $150,000 that year, you have to pay a big gift tax.  Some sort of trust fund and/or life insurance policy that the kid can claim after you die would be more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is an increased tax liability so bad?  Not for the truly rich.  These guys intend to give most of their wealth away to non-profit organizations.  The federal government funds roads and airports that we all enjoy using.  The feds pay for health care for the poor and the old.  Our tax dollars pay for intrepid military personnel who go out and kill angry foreigners (in most cases) before they can arrive on U.S. soil and kill Americans here at home.  For a non-profit organization of its size, the federal government is surprisingly efficient.  Most federal employees work in big box-like office buildings, not in $300 million monuments to some architect&amp;#8217;s ego.  George W. Bush gets paid only $400,000 per year, less than half of what a lot of university presidents earn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we tweak the $N bonus idea at all?  What if a kid becomes a repulsive yuppie despite the lack of financial necessity?  Won&amp;#8217;t his siblings become envious when Chad, Jr. gets a $3 million check from Chad, Sr. to supplement his $1 million/year earnings at J.P. Morgan?  Perhaps there should be a sliding scale for the bonus where the first $100,000/year is muliplied by 4, the next $100,000 by 3, the next $100,000 by 2, and the rest of the kid&amp;#8217;s income is not subject to a parental bonus.  Or there could be a lifetime cap of $10-20 million per kid (no Gulfstream for Johnny &lt;img src='http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':-(' class='wp-smiley' /&gt;  ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about tweaking the tax liability?  Perhaps the money could go first into an irrevocable trust, but only paid out by the trustee as a multiple of income.  I&amp;#8217;m not sure if this escapes gift/estate tax.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Movie Review: Miami Vice</title>

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it is great that aviation is featured in the film, at least as a tool for drug importers.  But to those of us who struggle to maintain proficiency and add ratings, it is humbling that a guy who spends most of his time playing with guns, cars, boats, and criminals seems to be able to fly anything with wings.

It was built and is managed by Steve Wynn, the man behind the Mirage and Bellagio. Wynn is built on the grounds and golf course of the Desert Inn, dynamited in 2001.  The Desert Inn was quiet and all of the rooms had balconies on which one could sit, read a book, and enjoy the desert air.  What happened to make the Desert Inn unprofitable?  &amp;#8220;Starwood bought it and they didn&amp;#8217;t understand the casino business,&amp;#8221; a bellman said.  &amp;#8220;I worked at the D.I. for 24 years.  The new managers came in and fired the casino hosts because they were expensive.  A casino host makes a base salary of $250,000 per year and then gets a percentage of whatever the people he brings in lose.  So you can see why someone would want to cut them out, but it turns out that you need these guys.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Desert Inn had 700 rooms; Wynn has 2700.  The hotel portion of Wynn is a big high-rise with plate glass windows that don&amp;#8217;t open.  Forget balconies.  When you&amp;#8217;re in your room, it is like being in an office building.  When you&amp;#8217;re in the rest of the facility, it is like being in a shopping mall.  The surfaces and finishes are sort of luxurious, but the environment makes one desperate to get out and see what the air feels like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Wynn is so huge and makes so little use of information technology, there is no advantage to being a guest.  If you want to get your car out of the valet, you need to have your ticket.  They don&amp;#8217;t record the name of the owner or the room number associated with a car.  If you lose your ticket, we were informed, you have to drive around the entire lot with a valet and look for your car.  When you find it, you have to prove that you own it (good luck with an airport courtesy car!).  If you want to walk out on the terrace and see the waterfall, you have to pay $20+ for drinks.  If you want to visit the Ferrari dealership on the ground floor, you and your fellow Wynn guest will have to pay $20 to get in (and then pay $38 for a baseball cap or $280,000-400,000 for a car (more than a brand-new four-seat Robinson R44 helicopter)), just like the rabble who walk in off the Strip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire hotel and casino pulses with a Pop music beat.  The pool area doesn&amp;#8217;t open until 8:00 am and the music is loud in every corner of the patio.  If you want to use the exercise machines, you have to pay an additional $25/day.  If you and your friend want to escape back to your room and use the Internet, it will cost you about $24/day to hook up your laptops.  When you&amp;#8217;ve just about finished writing a Weblog post and hit &amp;#8220;submit&amp;#8221;, Wynn&amp;#8217;s service will decide that you need to renew your agreement to pay for Internet service.  Your work will be thrown away and your browser redirected to a screen where you promise to pay them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some good things about Wynn:  comfortable beds, large and intelligently designed bathrooms (though it would have been nice if they cleaned the bathtub between our first and second night), friendly, helpful, and well-informed staff.  The nightly show, Le Reve, is fantastic.  The stage is a big round swimming pool with elaborate platforms for the Cirque de Soleil alumni to run around on.  Prodigious quantities of rain fall from the ceiling.  People fly and then dive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical travel tips:  If you have the $400+/night to spend on a Las Vegas hotel room, but want a bit of fresh air, consider the Ritz Carlton in Lake Las Vegas, a short drive east.  Some of their rooms have balconies, a feature that hotels on the Strip have been eliminating due, supposedly, to suicides by distraught gamblers.  If are on a tighter budget and want to be in a place where you can walk out of the casino into a public street, consider downtown Las Vegas where you can stroll on the shaded and misted Fremont Street.  If you really want to hang out at Wynn, stay for $45/night across the street at The Frontier where you can drink $1.99 margaritas while viewing the nightly female mud wrestling and bull riding.  Now you have an extra $350/day and can easily afford the services of the Wynn ($85 for a man&amp;#8217;s haircut, $70 for two people to dine at the buffet, etc.).  When you&amp;#8217;re done with Wynn, you get a bit of fresh air strolling back across the street to your hotel room.
&lt;/p&gt;

[...]</summary>&lt;p&gt;This is a report to friends and family on my main activity this week, a trip from Boston to Las Vegas in a Diamond Star DA40. The owner, my friend Tom, started the trip with 150 hours and a Private pilot&amp;#8217;s certificate. His goal is to get an instrument rating within the next few months. Tom&amp;#8217;s knowledge is almost perfectly complementary to mine. He knows about running marathons, living in the suburbs, keeping and wife and kids happy, and investing in bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip started Saturday morning with a 4:00 a.m. alarm clock. Tom showed up at 4:45 a.m. in an Aston Martin convertible. We struggled to fit our luggage and flight gear in the trunk and back seat. Only the British could make a car that is more expensive to own, less reliable, and less capacious than a trainer airplane. We lifted from the Minuteman airport in Stow, Massachusetts (6B6) at 6:15 am and went to Worcester, MA for a practice ILS approach then onward to Ithaca, NY for another ILS and a fuel stop. Our next leg was to Youngstown, Ohio where haze and cumulus clouds forced us to get a real instrument clearance and fly an ILS through actual conditions to land in the withering heat and humidity of the late morning. Our final destination was Chicago Midway where we went downtown to meet Jen for &amp;#8220;Venetian Night&amp;#8221; (crowds, lit-up boats), then collapsed  at the Hampton Inn next to Midway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we departed Midway at 7:30 a.m. for Iowa City, Iowa. The temperature was well into the 90s and a crazy high school girl was preparing to take her first flying lesson. After pounding back some cold drinks and chatting with folks at one of the country&amp;#8217;s friendliest FBOs, we departed for Lincoln, Nebraska. We landed in 102-degree (39C) heat and got organized with a rental car and rooms at the Cornhusker Marriott downtown. I walked over to the university to check out the three art galleries, including &lt;a href="http://www.sheldonartgallery.org/"&gt;one designed by Philip Johnso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sheldonartgallery.org/"&gt;n&lt;/a&gt;. There are enough interesting paintings and sculpture to inspire rebellion in the soul of the next Jackson Pollock (born in Cody, Wyoming, but the same general idea). We had a good dinner in the Haymarket district with Doug and Amy&amp;#8217;s friend Jill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over dinner at Fireworks, Jill told us of a sad local case involving a medevac helicopter pilot whose fancy turbine Agusta&amp;#8217;s tail rotor failed.  He must have done some sort of autorotation because there were survivors, but he was not among them.  He left behind a wife and seven children who are suing the manufacturer.  It is hard to believe that anyone can make money in aviation because, under the American legal system, Agusta ends up selling insurance when they thought they were selling helicopters.  The engineering reality is that it is impossible to make a helicopter that won&amp;#8217;t break.  If you made everything incredibly strong, the helicopter would be too heavy to fly.  Pilots are aware that at any time the engine or transmission or tail rotor could fail and it will be time for an autorotation.  There are areas of the planet and phases of flight where this won&amp;#8217;t result in a soft landing and that is one reason why being a commercial helicopter pilot is probably the most dangerous job in the U.S. (I&amp;#8217;ve not seen the stats broken out separately, but commercial pilot is one of the most dangerous and it includes airline 747 crew, whose jobs are not dangerous at all).  Nobody with a wife and seven kids depending on his next paycheck should take a job flying a helicopter unless he has a lot of life insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, after donning our oxygen cannulas, we departed Lincoln at 7:00 a.m., planning to follow I-80 to Salt Lake City. The sensible ways to cross the Rocky Mountains are I-80 (passes up to 9,000&amp;#8242; or so) and I-40 (passes up to 7,500&amp;#8242;). There were some thunderstorms and/or rain developing over both of these routes, so we diverted to Jeffco airport in the northwest suburbs of Denver, Colorado and refueled. I called flight service for an update and found that the winds aloft were light and mostly from the north, which meant that we wouldn&amp;#8217;t have too much lee side turbulence approaching the Rockies. More interestingly, there were a couple of pilot reports from small Cessnas that had made it across in the preceding hour or two. We were emboldened. We took off from Jeffco around 11:00 a.m. and climbed up to an indicated 14,500&amp;#8242; on the altimeter. Due to the high heat, we were closer to 15,000&amp;#8242; above sea level, a fact confirmed by the GPS, and well above the numerous 14,000+ peaks that I-70 threads its way throught. For flatlanders, this kind of flying is unnerving, but it was never unsafe. We landed in the early afternoon at Canyonlands (CNY) in Moab, Utah.  This was Tom&amp;#8217;s first landing at a high density altitude (8000&amp;#8242; or so) where he had to fly a pattern (at Jeffco we&amp;#8217;d done a practice ILS approach).  I said &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8217;re going to be going really fast over the ground at normal pattern airspeeds, so be sure to widen out&amp;#8221;.  Tom did so, but got down to a slower than normal airspeed of about 70 knots without realizing it.  The ground rush was consistent with our 85-90 knot groundspeed, so he thought he was flying a standard DA40 downwind at 85 knots or so.  We rented a brand new Jeep Wrangler, which was much noisier and bumpier than a 1995 Kia, did a short hike in Arches National Park, and had dinner at Buck&amp;#8217;s Grillhouse.  An older biker couple walked out to their Honda Goldwings.  The guy wore a badge on his leather jacket that had exactly the right shape and color for Harley Davidson&amp;#8217;s logo, but instead of reading &amp;#8220;Harley&amp;#8221; the badge read &amp;#8220;Asshole&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, we enjoyed a smooth morning flight over Bryce and Zion national parks, then did a practice instrument approach and landing at St. George, Utah.  It was getting bumpy and windy by the time we landed, just after noon, at Henderson, Nevada (HND).  22.9 hours on the Hobbs meter.

We showed him a bunch of computer software that we&amp;#8217;d built and pitched him on the idea of using computers to track the flow of materials and the state of the work, much as is done in any modern factory.  He said &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m not interested in anything that might save money.  This is a cost-plus project and the more we spend, the more profit we make. If we build this new highway using the same technology employed by the Romans, that&amp;#8217;s fine with me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictably, the project cost a lot more than planned, the guy we talked to made a lot more profit than budgeted, and the schedule slipped.  What wasn&amp;#8217;t predicted were the quality problems that have come to obsess Boston in recent weeks, after the death of Milena Del Valle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would the French have done?  (WWtFhD) The contract would not have been to build the road.  The contract would have been to build the road and maintain it for 20 years, thus giving the contractor an incentive to maintain high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Note that this is a separate practice from the French allowing private companies to build, maintain, and operate private toll roads.]

One year [...]</summary>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I always wondered was &amp;#8220;How am I ever going to teach someone to land an airplane?&amp;#8221;  The flare happens fairly fast and the difference between a reasonable and damaging landing is a matter of just a few seconds and/or an inch or two of stick movement.  One year after receiving my CFI, I think that I&amp;#8217;ve finally figured it out.  Most people flare too early.  They are going 60 knots and plummeting toward what looks like a hard and unforgiving asphalt surface.  When that runway gets close, they start to yank back on the stick.  The result is a balloon, the airplane loses flying speed about 15&amp;#8242; above the ground and then the sickening sink begins.  The instructor wonders &amp;#8220;How am I going to live this one down if we bend the gear?&amp;#8221; while adding power.  The student is frustrated because the controls have been grabbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new religion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;insist that student trim the airplane for approach speed and verify that it is properly trimmed by removing hands from stick at 200&amp;#8242; AGL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;remind the student to look far down the runway as we approach the ground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put a fist behind the stick so that the potential travel of the stick is limited&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;talk the student through the flare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The student will probably still try to flare too hard and maybe too high, but it won&amp;#8217;t matter because you&amp;#8217;ve limited the rearward movement of the stick.  After a few of these, the student learns the correct attitudes for landing and stops pulling back so hard.
&lt;/p&gt;

That's right, you can now put more than one optical drive in your Mac tower (and more than two hard drives inside)—more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;How well does this dual-Xeon, quad-core workstation this measure up to its PowerPC predecessor as well as the rest of Apple's Intel lineup?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/arstechnica/BAaf?a=H5zc2c"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/arstechnica/BAaf?i=H5zc2c" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/BAaf/~4/11146767"/&gt;</summary>

If you don't run high-end professional applications and don't truly need a huge amount of internal storage or access to PCI Express slots, you might find that the remarkably powerful 20-inch iMac Core Duo is a much better value.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.macworld.com/~a/macworld/all?a=hHNyTE"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macworld.com/~a/macworld/all?i=hHNyTE" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.macworld.com/~r/macworld/all/~4/13568057"/&gt;</summary>

The short answer is that I haven't had a lot of time. When I wasn't up in Truckee &lt;a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SoarTruckee/message/177"&gt;flying&lt;/a&gt; my glider on the weekends (including a recently &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jzawodn/sets/72157594237581806/"&gt;landout at Carson City&lt;/a&gt;), I was busy studying for the FAA Private Pilot Knowledge Test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, I've taken these FAA written exams in the past. I took one in college, one for my Private Pilot Glider rating, and another for my Commercial Pilot Glider rating. In the past I've used a mix of book study (using the &lt;a href="http://www.asa2fly.com/"&gt;ASA books&lt;/a&gt;) and on-line practice tests like Kip's &lt;a href="http://exams4pilots.org/"&gt;Exams4Pilots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This time around, I decided to spend about 1/3rd of my time using DVD courses and preparation. I tried both the &lt;a href="http://www.sportys.com/acb/showdetl.cfm?&amp;did=19&amp;product_id=9503"&gt;Sporty's videos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.kingschools.com/productDetail.asp?itemNo=EPD%20PPEC%20DVDPC"&gt;King Schools Videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Comparing the two, there's no contest. The King Videos are far more interesting, engaging, and complete than those produced by Sporty's. The folks at Sporty's appear to have opted for "star power" by using folks like Richard Collins in the videos, while the John and Martha king focus more on the content and material you need to learn. Granted, they style and sense of humor is a bid odd at times, but it really gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're shopping for flight training or test prep DVDs, I highly recommend looking at the King Schools videos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I passed the test, of course. :-) Soon I'll be working to finish up my training and get the FAA checkride scheduled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/007209.html#comments"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;I passed the test, of course. :-)  Soon I'll be working to finish up my training and get the FAA checkride scheduled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/007209.html#comments"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;<category term="Flying"/>2006-08-15T20:17:51-08:00</entry>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;From the API news department...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;del.icio.us API over https&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;My linkblog recently broke for a bit. It's powered by &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/"&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; and a bit of curl and Perl. Luckily Toby pinged me to say "hey dumbass, fix your script..." Why? There's &lt;a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2006/08/security_everyb.html"&gt;a new API in place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/help/api/"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; is pretty much the same, except that it's now accessible via &lt;em&gt;https&lt;/em&gt; rather than &lt;em&gt;http&lt;/em&gt; and it versioned as well. So my old "fetch all bookmarks" script looked like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;curl --silent --user jzawodn:mypassword -o links.xml.$$ \ -O 'http://del.icio.us/api/posts/all'&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;and it now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;curl --silent --user jzawodn:mypassword -o links.xml.$$ \ -O 'https://api.del.icio.us/v1/posts/all'&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now I see that running &lt;a href="http://curl.haxx.se/"&gt;curl&lt;/a&gt; with &#150;slient and without &#150;L was a bad idea. Lesson learned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also got a sneak peak at version 2.0 of the API and really like what I see. del.icio.us is really going to be a killer bookmarking/tagging platform what that stuff ships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Answers API Launched&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/"&gt;Yahoo! Answers&lt;/a&gt; also got API'd today. Using the &lt;a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/answers/"&gt;Answers API&lt;/a&gt;, you can search questions based on keywords, get details, and so on. Check out the "Try It Now" interactive thingy that &lt;a href="http://www.mindsack.com/"&gt;Kent&lt;/a&gt; put together on the documentation page.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can't imagine trying to do that with SOAP. :-)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with other stuff, you can get responses back as XML, PHP, or JSON.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The API is fairly basic and read-only for now, but there's more work going on behind the scenes.

      <title>The AOL Search Data and Liquids on Airlines</title>

Is that the best world for us?&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way I'd phrase it is that I'm really glad it happened, (a) because now we can talk about how important it is, and (b) because it didn't happen to Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Liquids on Airlines&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just when I thought the airlines and/or TSA couldn't get anymore stupid, they went and banned virtually all liquids on commercial airline flights.

I can't believe that the airlines didn't push back against these new rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If someone asks me to fly somewhere between now and whenever they come to their senses, I'll politely decline.

      <title>Blog Stats: Bloglines Share of Feedburner Numbers?</title>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of folks out there use &lt;a href="http://www.feedburner.com/"&gt;FeedBurner&lt;/a&gt; to outsource the hosting and metrics of their RSS feeds.

I believe there's enough bias in the types of people who even use Bloglines that the number I'm asking for aren't terribly meaningful in getting at their share of the market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any, please share if you have such data. I've always assumed (meaning that I pulled this out of my ass) that Bloglines represents between 30% and 50% of my subscribers. But for all I know, I'm way, way off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your numbers could help to triangulate a bit.

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Matt McAlister wrote &lt;a href="http://www.mattmcalister.com/blog/2006/07/19/78/thoughts-about-working-at-yahoo-after-one-year/"&gt;Thoughts about working at Yahoo! after one year&lt;/a&gt; in which he summarized his favorite and not so favorite things about working here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'd like to enumerate his 13 points and add my take, as someone who has worked in different parts of Yahoo for a bit longer.

      <title>China Making Sure That User Generated Content Is Officially Registered Content First</title>Mike<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/1914235.shtml</link>
      <id>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/1914235.shtml</id>
      <summary>China has a long history of being a bureaucratic society -- and it seems they're really learned how to apply that bureaucracy to the internet. They have &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060403/0216237.shtml"&gt;tens of thousands&lt;/a&gt; of people monitoring the internet, for example. However, they're really going to ridiculous extremes in trying to slow down the production of non-approved content. A year ago, we mentioned that they wanted &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050530/2340236_F.shtml"&gt;every website to register with the government&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this year, they wanted &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060414/1249203.shtml"&gt;everyone who ran an email server&lt;/a&gt; to register as well. The latest, then, really isn't too surprising. With the rapid rise in popularity of online video sites, the Chinese government is now planning to &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/16/HNchinavideoclips_1.html?source=rss&amp;url=http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/16/HNchinavideoclips_1.html"&gt;require every user-created video to first be "approved"&lt;/a&gt; before it can be posted online. Considering the pace at which people add videos to sites like YouTube and Google Video, this sounds like a nearly impossible task if you actually want people to generate content. Of course, that's the point. They &lt;i&gt;don't&lt;/i&gt; want people to generate their own content, because they might produce content the government doesn't like.</summary>

      <title>Recording Industry Bans Musician From Charts For Supporting Free Music</title>Mike<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/1820225.shtml</link>
      <id>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/1820225.shtml</id>
      <summary>One of the favorite lines out of the recording industry honchos when confronted about musicians who are &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060426/1153211.shtml"&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; industry efforts to sue individuals who share files is that the industry execs support whatever choice the musicians make for themselves. If the musicians want to free their music, the execs say, that's their choice. Funny, then, that the industry execs are acting out against a young musician who wants her music to be free. BPI, the UK version of the RIAA, has &lt;a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=33734"&gt;banned a twelve year-old singer songwriter&lt;/a&gt; from a new music chart they were creating for schools. The reason, apparently, is that BPI doesn't want to promote young Amy Thomas' music, since she's signed to a music label that doesn't support BPI's stance on suing file sharers. Obviously, BPI is free to set up its charts however it wants -- but it really should stop claiming to the world that it represents whatever artists want.</summary>

      <title>Beyond The Privacy Outcry, AOL Search Data Actually Is Interesting Info</title>Mike<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/1726209.shtml</link>

      <summary>&lt;B&gt;Beck&lt;/B&gt; writes &lt;I&gt;"There has been much hoopla over the privacy concerns regarding AOL's &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060807/0219238.shtml"&gt;release of search data&lt;/a&gt;. Lost in the excitement is the fact that AOL had good intentions. They wanted to give researchers a window into how people use online search. If you step back for a moment and take a look, the findings are interesting. Lee Gomes of the Wall Street Journal &lt;A href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB115568221756536623-sqggNBpJImZupJmvthdQfzouGn8_20060914.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top"&gt;published the results of his research&lt;/a&gt;. He did not approach the story from the privacy angle, but rather from the view of a researcher who wants to know how people use the Internet. He found, for example, that the most common search term is the word "free". Also interesting is that 47% of searches resulted in no click by the user. 28% of searches were refinements of previous searches, and 42% of the time the user clicks on the first item in the search results. The article includes additional data, and a look at the quality of the search results."&lt;/I&gt;</summary>

      <title>Last Person You Talked To At A Call Center Probably Wasn't Faking American Accent</title>Joe<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/1527233.shtml</link>
      <id>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/1527233.shtml</id>
      <summary>Judging by stories in the media, you might think that India dominates the market for call centers, and we're probably a little guilty of &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/article.php?sid=20060731/1126213&amp;threaded=true"&gt;feeding this perception&lt;/a&gt; as well. But the actual numbers paint a different picture; the US still &lt;a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/articles/default.asp?ArticleID=6267"&gt;dominates this space&lt;/a&gt;, as 62% of all global call center jobs are in the country. India's share is just 5%. And while the percentage has declined in the US, the net number of jobs has actually risen; in the past four years, the economy has created 183,000 new positions. It's not surprising that these numbers aren't often told. Layoffs make for a much better story than hiring. And while it's been noted plenty that Indian economic growth doesn't hurt our own economy, it's interesting that even this one specific industry isn't a zero-sum game.</summary>

      <title>What's Next, Ad-Supported Text Books? Oh Wait...</title>Joe<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/1416222.shtml</link>
      <id>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/1416222.shtml</id>
      <summary>A company called Free Load Press is looking to use the &lt;a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/T/TEXTBOOKS_ADVERTISING?SITE=WDUN&amp;SECTION=US&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT"&gt;ad-supported model&lt;/a&gt; to distribute college textbooks. After filling out a survey, students can download free PDF textbooks with ads for companies like Fedex Kinko's. Obviously, the company faces an enormous uphill battle trying to convince professors to assign their textbooks, as opposed to those sold by established publishing houses. And a lot of people will find ad-supported books unseemly. But the story highlights how messed up the current textbook market is. Although it's students who foot the bill for new books, it's professors who make the decision about what book to use. Of course, the professor doesn't have any incentive to shop around for price, and so prices spiral higher. Furthermore, the textbook oligopoly (Thomson, Pearson, and McGraw-Hill) feels it has to charge more to make up for the growing secondary market for used text. But endless price increases are the very reason for the secondary market and new experiments such as this one. This is not to mention the fact that the textbook industry, like the music industry, wants to sell the same product &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060124/176212_F.shtml"&gt;over and over again&lt;/a&gt;. That's why they keep putting out new versions of textbooks even though little has been added to them. As Scott Mcnealy put it in a &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2006/08/04/sun-mcnealy-education-cx_gl_0804autofacescan02.html"&gt;recent interview&lt;/a&gt;, there's no reason to keep spending money on new textbooks as "Math hasn't changed since Isaac Newton." So whether Free Load Press works out is not the point; this is clearly a market anxious for a way around the textbook cartel and its attendant pricing.</summary>

      <title>Didn't See This Coming: Phantom Console Disappears</title>Carlo<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/1123208.shtml</link>
      <id>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/1123208.shtml</id>
      <summary>It appears that Phantom Entertainment has finally given up the ghost on its long-promised gaming console of the same name -- the company's web site has been redone &lt;a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/08/15/gasp-phantom-console-fails-to-materialize/"&gt;and the console isn't mentioned anywhere&lt;/a&gt;. We're still waiting on the special gaming keyboard &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060720/0917251.shtml"&gt;the company is supposedly focusing on&lt;/a&gt;, though it's now accepting orders for it. But the Phantom console lives on in spirit, as another &lt;strike&gt;piece of vaporware&lt;/strike&gt; planned offering: the "first" on-demand online games service. Apparently it's just the reworked Phantom online element, now intended to run on Windows PCs rather than its own console. The company's getting a little craftier, not giving any projected release dates for it to miss (like &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20051123/152210.shtml"&gt;so many before&lt;/a&gt;, but we'd still bet on seeing &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060206/0921208.shtml"&gt;Duke Nukem Forever&lt;/a&gt; first. Also, doing little to dispel the belief held by some that &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041202/1056234.shtml"&gt;the company is a scam&lt;/a&gt;, the company &lt;a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6155882.html"&gt;delayed filing its quarterly report&lt;/a&gt; -- one that yet again showed no income.</summary>

      <summary>For years and years people have been pointing out the &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060731/124206.shtml"&gt;massive security flaws&lt;/a&gt; in e-voting machines. While the companies in the space &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20051216/0131247.shtml"&gt;laugh off the problem&lt;/a&gt; or try to &lt;A href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060327/1133205.shtml"&gt;block those&lt;/a&gt; who try to make sure the devices are secure, it seems like more and more people are beginning to recognize the problems with the machines. They're speaking up and letting &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060720/1134234.shtml"&gt;politicians know&lt;/a&gt; that they're uncomfortable with these machines. The latest is that yet another &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/15/AR2006081501202.html?nav=rss_technology"&gt;lawsuit has been filed to stop these machines&lt;/a&gt; from being used in elections. This lawsuit is in Pennsylvania but is similar to lawsuits elsewhere. It's certainly true that no voting system is perfectly secure -- but the level of &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060627/1511200.shtml"&gt;&lt;i&gt;correctable&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; problems found in many e-voting machines, combined with the &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20031216/0946233.shtml"&gt;level of disdain&lt;/a&gt; the equipment makers show towards those who point out the flaws makes it worthwhile to try to stop these machines from being used in elections.</summary>

      <title>Ignoring Obsolete Analog Technology Is Now Considered Circumventing Copy Protection?</title>Mike<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/121202.shtml</link>
      <id>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/121202.shtml</id>
      <summary>The "anti-circumvention" clause of the DMCA is perhaps its most controversial, leading to lots of &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060622/2350220.shtml"&gt;complaints&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050901/179258.shtml"&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; and attempts to &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20040621/2334237.shtml"&gt;change the law&lt;/a&gt;. It seems particularly ridiculous that it basically criminalizes some uses that are protected by fair use rules. However, it also can create some tricky questions about what, exactly, is "circumvention" of a copy protection system. The EFF is now getting involved in one such case. As many people know, Macrovision creates a very basic type of copy protection for VCR tapes. What it does is degrade any copy by adding a lot of "noise" to it, making it nearly unwatchable. However, the noise is added to the vertical blanking interval (VBI), used in analog broadcasting officially to reset a traditional TV's beam, but also used to send additional information. For digital converters, it's easy to ignore the VBI (especially since there's no beam to reset on a digital TV), which is exactly what one company did. Of course, that means that the forced degradation of copied videotapes disappears. To Macrovision, apparently, ignoring an otherwise useless bit of information &lt;a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004878.php"&gt;is considered "circumventing" their copy protection scheme&lt;/a&gt;. As the EFF notes in their filing against Macrovision, it seems ridiculous that any company should be forced to include what's basically an obsolete technology that serves no purpose, just for the sake of adding noise to copied tapes.</summary>

      <title>I Screwed Up: Comments Deleted</title>Mike<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/1124257.shtml</link>

      <summary>Like plenty of other blogs, we get a fair amount of comment spam, averaging about 1,000 spam messages a day (and going as high as 4,000). We have a decent spam filter that manages to catch the vast majority of them, but a few get through every day. I was just going through today's comments in our comment admin tool, and was trying to delete the 10 or so spams that had gotten through this morning. In doing so, I clicked on the wrong button, and ended up deleting &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of the legitimate comments since about 4am this morning. That was about 400 comments. Yes, it's ridiculous that our comment admin tool would let me do such thing. Yes, it's ridiculous that we don't have a way to go back and retrieve them once deleted. We're now in the process of changing the comment admin tool to make it so my fat fingers/slow brain won't be able to make the same mistake again. Apologies all around...</summary>

      <summary>&lt;b&gt;Rajesh&lt;/b&gt; writes &lt;I&gt;"BusinessWeek devotes an article to &lt;A href="http://yahoo.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2006/tc20060816_466084.htm"&gt;Webroot propaganda&lt;/a&gt; to associate everyone's new favorite bogeyman, MySpace, with the spyware problem: "Spyware's threat is getting nastier. Infection rates are on the rise, in part thanks to the surging popularity of social-networking sites like MySpace.com" OK. Where's the proof? Nada. But there's plenty of self-serving evidence, such as anecdotal quotes, from Webroot executives: "We're finding that the social-networking sites like MySpace are turning out to be hotbeds for spyware," CEO Dave Moll says. "People are creating multiple profiles, and the links on their sites will take you to sites that will either download or drive-by download adware and spyware." I guess Webroot has to &lt;A href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050207/0111259.shtml"&gt;justify that ridiculous valuation&lt;/a&gt; they managed to sucker VCs into and fight &lt;A href="http://www.informationweek.com/security/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=192200097&amp;subSection=Spam/Spyware"&gt;Microsoft's challenge&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/I&gt; To be fair, there have been some &lt;A href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060709/2318215.shtml"&gt;documented cases&lt;/a&gt; of spyware makers targeting MySpace. However, at the same time, Webroot has a long history of &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050503/1148256.shtml"&gt;exaggerating threats&lt;/a&gt; to justify their valuation. Usually that includes things like including "tracking cookies" in their count of spyware to make it seem like a lot more computers are infected than really are at risk. The company also claimed that spyware was becoming an even bigger problem when &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050823/0148243.shtml"&gt;their own numbers&lt;/a&gt; showed the opposite was true.</summary>

      <title>Court Backs FCC's Fiber Line-Sharing Rules</title>Carlo<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/0832208.shtml</link>
      <id>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/0832208.shtml</id>
      <summary>Even before last year's decision to &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20050805/1029253.shtml"&gt;stop forcing telcos&lt;/a&gt; to allow outside companies to lease their phone lines, the FCC had already said the telcos &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20041008/0924229.shtml"&gt;wouldn't have to share&lt;/a&gt; the fiber-optic networks they were building. Earthlink, which has been actively selling its broadband access over other companies' networks for some time, appealed this order, but a court has denied it, &lt;a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=governmentFilingsNews&amp;storyID=2006-08-15T171657Z_01_N15405130_RTRIDST_0_TELECOMS-FCC.XML"&gt;leaving the FCC order in place&lt;/a&gt;. Earthlink argued that the FCC didn't adequately assess the level of competition in the broadband market -- something that's not hard to believe given the &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060508/1839210.shtml"&gt;discredited statistics&lt;/a&gt; the FCC keeps on broadband penetration. While not mandating line-sharing might level the playing field between the telcos and cable providers, it's unclear how shutting out third-party competitors &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20041215/1035210.shtml"&gt;has a positive effect&lt;/a&gt; on the overall level of &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20051221/1349251.shtml"&gt;competition for services&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the benefits of creating a more efficient, shared broadband infrastructure go largely ignored. So bring on the new wireless competitors, though plenty of &lt;a href="http://techdirt.com/articles/20060809/1149258.shtml"&gt;doubts about their efficacy&lt;/a&gt;, and overall impact on broadband competition, remain.</summary>

      <title>Would a Sirius/XM Merger Stop The Rot?</title>Carlo<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/0741205.shtml</link>
      <id>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/0741205.shtml</id>
      <summary>Shares of satellite radio providers Sirius and XM have been getting pummeled as the companies' losses &lt;a href="http://www.emailthis.clickability.com/et/emailThis?clickMap=viewThis&amp;etMailToID=1799066016"&gt;continue to mount&lt;/a&gt;. Despite consumer interest in the product, the companies simply &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050224/1151253.shtml"&gt;haven't been able to make the business model work&lt;/a&gt; -- their customer-acquistion costs remain high and content costs grow as the two companies &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041019/1828204.shtml"&gt;compete for talent&lt;/a&gt; and exclusive deals. We've wondered before if &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20040322/0957202_F.shtml"&gt;bankruptcy and restructuring&lt;/a&gt; would be the only way these companies could survive, but there's a growing clamor &lt;a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&amp;storyID=2006-08-16T060642Z_01_N16448085_RTRUKOC_0_US-SATELLITE.xml&amp;pageNumber=0&amp;imageid=&amp;cap=&amp;sz=13&amp;WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage3"&gt;for XM and Sirius to merge&lt;/a&gt;. There are some benefits such a deal would hold that are pretty obvious: they could quit competing against each other for deals to broadcast sports and other content, holding costs down, and they could shift the customer-acquisition battle from being one they're fighting against each other to one that tries to attract new users in a more profitable manner. There would be some big questions over the deal, not the least of which the challenge of dealing with two sets of redundant satellites and networks, and a user base whose equipment is only made to work with one or the other. It's unclear how a merger would restructure the cost base of the satellite networks, which have saddled the companies with debt. Conceivably, the government could also block a merger between the two on competition grounds, though any such action would ignore the fact that XM and Sirius &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060628/0959226.shtml"&gt;aren't just competing with each other&lt;/a&gt;.</summary>

      <title>Comcast's Internet Strategy Stuck In Summer Repeats</title>Joe<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/0738251.shtml</link>

      <summary>Ever since Comcast's &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20040316/2319230_F.shtml"&gt;failed attempt&lt;/a&gt; to merge with Disney, it's been no secret that the company still buys into the idea that marrying distribution and content is a good idea. Now the company's ambitions are getting attention again, as it's making &lt;a href="http://adage.com/digital/article?article_id=111104"&gt;clear signals&lt;/a&gt; that it wants to be a full-fledged portal a la Yahoo. Already its web services, based at Comcast.net, are widely used by its broadband customers (or so the company claims), as is its online video service dubbed The Fan. But its belief that it can turn its web properties into popular services on a national level is based on the idea that Comcast is in the best position to aggregate video content. While it may have a leg up over a site like Yahoo, in negotiating deals with TV networks (simply due to its already-existing relationships with them), it's hard to see the company doing anything but trying to re-invent cable TV online -- something the cable industry &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060626/2248201.shtml"&gt;has tried before&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20020121/0121212.shtml"&gt;pretty disastrous&lt;/a&gt; consequences. Combined with the fact that Comcast has little brand recognition outside of its service area, such a plan will probably result in a lot of wasted effort.</summary>

      <title>Satellite TV Companies First Wireless Auction Casualties</title>Carlo<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/0637247.shtml</link>
      <id>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060816/0637247.shtml</id>
      <summary>The FCC's Advanced Wireless Services spectrum auction is chugging right along, with bidding up to a total of nearly $9 billion after Tuesday's rounds. There's not been much going on beyond the usual round-by-round one-upping between the major players, with Verizon Wireless and T-Mobile leading the way, but Tuesday did see what essentially amounts to &lt;a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/tv/1401AP_Airwaves_Auction.html"&gt;the exit of satellite providers&lt;/a&gt; DirecTV and Echostar from the auction. The companies, which had joined together to bid, &lt;a href="http://news.techdirt.com/news/wireless/article/6386"&gt;had made a lot of noise&lt;/a&gt; before the auction about their wireless broadband plans, but apparently finally realized that the billion dollars &lt;a href="http://news.techdirt.com/news/wireless/article/6315"&gt;they were talking about spending&lt;/a&gt; wouldn't get them very far, with bids on the 10 MHz regional licenses taking the total for nationwide coverage over $4 billion. So what's next for the satellite companies? They could wait until next year and bid on 700 MHz spectrum, but that won't be available for use until 2009, and could fetch an even higher price than the AWS spectrum, since it's regarded as better. What's more likely is that they'll strike up a partnership with a wireless broadband provider -- rumors about a deal with Clearwire have been fairly persistent.</summary>

      <title>Can You Sue Google Because You Don't Like The Type Of Ads It Puts Up Near Your Listing?</title>Mike<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060815/1834219.shtml</link>
      <id>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060815/1834219.shtml</id>
      <summary>There have been plenty of stories concerning lawsuits against Google from companies that &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050331/135200.shtml"&gt;don't like&lt;/a&gt; others buying text ads based on the original company's name as a keyword. While the court results on these cases is mixed, it seems like Google should easily win. First, and most importantly, the complaint shouldn't be against Google, but against the companies doing the advertising. Second, it's not a violation of trademarks. Trademarks are only supposed to protect against consumer confusion, not give the owner complete control over the use of the mark. However, it looks like there's a slightly different variation on these types of cases over in the Netherlands. There, a dating site for farmers (talk about &lt;A href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060815/1731227.shtml"&gt;niches&lt;/a&gt;...) is complaining when people search Google for their site, the &lt;a href="http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=31&amp;aid=106079"&gt;ads that show up are for "sex" sites&lt;/a&gt;. The dating site is worried that such advertisements damage the image of their own site. It's an interesting legal question -- though, again, it may be a difficult for the company to win. If others believe that the dating site is most closely associated with sex, then it's not exactly Google's fault. Of course, this also raises another question: if others set up a &lt;A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bomb"&gt;Google bomb&lt;/a&gt; so that other such sites showed up in the organic listings, would the company still be able to complain? Google says they won't adjust their organic listings, even in the event of a Google bomb -- so it's difficult to see how you could blame Google for the sites your company is associated with. The dating site's explanation is a bit weak as well, claiming that just because Google &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; block such advertisements, it means it has an obligation to do so.</summary>

      <title>AOL Goes Digging For Gold (Yes, Literally)</title>Mike<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060815/2012205.shtml</link>
      <id>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060815/2012205.shtml</id>
      <summary>A year ago, AOL had a contest where they decided to &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050809/1739250.shtml"&gt;give away $20,000 in gold bars&lt;/a&gt; they had received from spammer Brad Bournival, as part of their settlement with him. Bournival is a name that should be familiar to anyone who read Brian McWilliams' excellent book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596007329/techdirtcom/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spam Kings&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Bournival, if you recall, was the apprentice to the book's main character, Davis Wolfgang Hawke. While Bournival was willing to cooperate when authorities cracked down on their spamming activities, Hawke ran. However, since AOL won their case against both spammers, it feels that Hawke still owes them plenty of money. In the book, it details how Hawke would hide his money all over the place often in the form of gold bars, and apparently the folks at AOL have taken notice. They're now trying to &lt;a href="http://www.thebostonchannel.com/news/9685050/detail.html"&gt;dig up the backyard of Hawke's parents, in search of more gold bars&lt;/a&gt;. A judge has given permission for the search, which AOL says shouldn't be too destructive -- but Hawke's mother is vowing to fight the search, saying she has no clue where her son is and she's sure he didn't bury any gold on their property.</summary>

      <title>Why Should Jack Thompson Get Early Access To A Video Game?</title>Mike<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060815/1940229.shtml</link>
      <id>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060815/1940229.shtml</id>
      <summary>As was &lt;A href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20060811/124202.shtml"&gt;widely expected&lt;/a&gt;, Jack Thompson is getting ready to &lt;a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/news/2006/08/15/Jack_is_back_to_beat_up_on_Bully/"&gt;file his latest lawsuit against Take Two/Rockstar games&lt;/a&gt; over their latest game, &lt;i&gt;Bully&lt;/i&gt;. As we noted last week, this is especially amusing in light of the reviews that seem to suggest the game isn't what Thompson seems to think it is -- rather it's the video game equivalent of plenty of goofy movies such as &lt;i&gt;Rushmore&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Napoleon Dynamite&lt;/i&gt;. Of course, Thompson has an answer to this -- claiming that the reviews are only in "fawning" publications that receive money from Take Two. Yes, publications like &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/10/arts/10bull.html?ex=1312862400&amp;en=f539b0a684d4468b&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss"&gt;the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-08-09-bully-preview_x.htm"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;A href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=technologyNews&amp;storyID=2006-08-09T143111Z_01_N88269412_RTRUKOC_0_US-MEDIA-BULLY.xml&amp;WTmodLoc=Home-C5-technologyNews-2"&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; -- not exactly a group of publications likely to puff up a review for the sake of some ad dollars from a small video game company. However, what's really interesting, is that Thompson is apparently demanding a pre-release copy of the game. He seems to think that the company is required to give him a copy of the game before it's released so he can "analyze" it. Why bother, when it's clear that he's already decided the game is evil?</summary>

      <summary>If you hadn't noticed lately, it seems like just about every publicly traded tech company has been dealing with accusations of backdating options. Usually, the stories show up in the press briefly and then disappear as no one really cares that much. While there have been a few stories of people getting &lt;a href="http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2006/08/07/1776622.htm"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; over the backdating issue, it seems like most of the tech world is still waiting to see just how serious an issue this becomes. While it has caused a few people to lose their jobs, it's still a bit surprising to see the CEO of a large tech company &lt;a href="http://www.redherring.com/article.aspx?a=17971"&gt;go on the lam&lt;/a&gt;. But that's just what happened to the ex-CEO of Comverse -- who has apparently disappeared (just after he apparently transferred millions of dollars out of American banks). The details of the Comverse story sound a little worse -- as they apparently set up some sort of stock option slush fund for employees, which was kept secret from the board. Still, with so many companies involved, the various arrests and now an exec on the run, you get the feeling this is a story that's only going to get a lot more interesting in the next few months. Already, there's talk that it's simply &lt;a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2006/tc20060815_814875.htm?campaign_id=bier_tcutw"&gt;a witch hunt&lt;/a&gt; by an SEC looking for people to go after, rather than shareholders to protect.</summary>

      <summary>Yes, we all realize that the internet and all that "long tail" stuff means that perhaps there really is a space for narrowly focused niche sites... but did anyone really expect &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2006-08-15-orangutan-online-dating_x.htm?POE=TECISVA"&gt;an online dating site for orangutans&lt;/a&gt;? Turns out some zookeepers are setting up such a site with the hope of seeing if orangutans from different zoos are compatible with each other. The mating ritual will involve allowing the orangutans to give each other some food at the push of a button. Of course, there are still a few logistical problems to work out: they need to come up with "ape-proof cables and screens," for example. Obviously, this is more of a publicity move to draw interest in orangutans than any real attempt to get them to date, but it's still an amusing reminder that, while the internet is about communicating, it doesn't necessarily need to be between humans.</summary>

      <title>Call 911, He Stole My Magic Sword</title>Joe<link>http://techdirt.com/articles/20060815/148249.shtml</link>

      <summary>At a gaming conference, Microsoft warned that multi-player online games have &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4794139.stm"&gt;significant security vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;, and that the growing value of in game assets was a juicy target for criminals. As we've seen in the past, MMORPGs are facing more and more &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20050120/105218_F.shtml"&gt;real world complications&lt;/a&gt; as people invest an increasing amount of money into them. This problem is only going to get worse; as one Microsoft researcher put it, "The police are really good at understanding someone stole my credit card and ran up a lot of money. It's a lot harder to get them to buy into 'someone stole my magic sword.'" But before discussing how law enforcement can address the situation, game developers and players should try to define the border between the game and the real world. For example, most people would accept that if your character is mugged inside a game, then that's part of the gameplay, not a legal issue. But what about counterfeiting gold pieces? What about running a script inside the game that transfers gold from one player to another? Before diverting law enforcement resources to rectify players' complaints, companies running online games need to strive to develop their own security measures that satisfy their players.</summary>

      <summary>&lt;body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt; &lt;p&gt; I'm trying to get back into diving. Went to Edmonds the other day and had horrible visibility, but it got me re-acquainted with my basics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Tonight I went diving with a new group of folks (old friends, actually) at Alki Cove 2. I've done the dive a dozen or more times, so it was a great second round of dives. We did a pre-dive briefing where the dive master was fairly nervous about me tackling a 90+' dive with Nitrox after a year being absent. I said I'd watch myself and was going to take it easy. Down we went. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Awesome dive. I did great on my air consumption and bouyency control. Looked at the I-beams, we through the honeybear (both landmarks in Cove 2). Just all around a very enjoyable dive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Get out, switch tanks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; More folks show up. We mix up the buddies a little bit. Three of us are partnered and we head out. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We didn't have a super clear dive plan. Rich is leading, he's the guy I know of the group. Last dive on the way back he was slightly off on navigating to the shore, but overall a very competent diver. We descend to 100'. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Start working our way back up. Boy, we've been at 80' for a while. Shouldn't it be getting shallower soon? The honeybear is only in 60' of water (or so). Look at my air gauge - plenty left. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Something wierd happens. Rich is looking around. Seargant Pepper (the other diver with us) is up "talking" with him on a slate. Does Rich know where he is? 80' is a lot of water. I wonder how that woman ended up at 100' with no air. Do I have enough air? 80' is a lot of water. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It hits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Panic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I've never felt anything like this. I know that I'm fine. I logically know I have plenty of air. But suddenly - &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; YOU MUST BE AT THE SURFACE. HUMANS DON'T BREATH UNDERWATER. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Calm down. Look at the gauge. Plenty of air. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; GET TO THE SURFACE. BREATH! BREATH! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I do a quick sanity check, yep, I'm panicing. I signal the other guys - we have to surface. I can't convince my body that everything is OK. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; My training kicks in - you need to ascend slowly. You need to focus on the other divers. You need to remember to watch your gauges. Breath slowly. Long shallow breaths. No need to panic, just surface and call the dive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; SURFACE! WATER! BREATH! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The other guys are ascending. I'm slowing working through the steps to go up. I don't want to pop up too quickly. The other divers come down to check on me. I signalled for a surface, but I'm still sitting at the bottom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Slowly I start to ascend. A little too quickly, slow down. Then sink. Ugh. Ascending again. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Need to stop at 15' for a saftey stop. The other guys are going straight up. They have no idea what is going on. I figure that I better go up to them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Get to the surface. Panic is all gone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Horrible dive. I'm happy that I called the dive and got out. I should have been clearer in my communication with my buddies about what was going on. We could have all done a slow ascent with a safter stop. As it was, we weren't down long enough to really have any major worries. All the dive computers were only slightly unhappy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Looking back, it is tremendously interesting how quickly and all encompasing panic can be. I've never had this type of panic in any situation. I could really feel it clawing to get control. I'm so happy that I had taken so many training classes that walked through the symptoms and how to handle it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; My dive buddies were great. They did exactly the right thing the entire time. They (of course) knew exactly where they were. Rich and Seargant were looking at a slate the Seargant found on the bottom, there was no confusion. We were on track to hit the honeybear, it was just taking a few minutes longer than last time. Both guys were quick to say that they fully supported calling the dive. They where very confused by my behavior, but no one was in any danger. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I learned a couple important lessons: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; Make sure you understand the dive plan, how long each leg should take, depths, etc.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; If you feel that something is wrong, determine the correction, communicate your plan (with your slate if need be), and then act deliberately&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Panic is real, and can't easily be controlled&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt; I related the story to Megan, her advice - you need to get back into the water as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt;</summary>

            If you feel that something is wrong, determine the correction, communicate your plan
            (with your slate if need be), and then act deliberately
            Panic is real, and can't easily be controlled
        I related the story to Megan, her advice - you need to get back into the water as
        soon as possible.

My guess is that once I finish reviews i'll tip just north of 300, which was my goal.

      <title>Bound for Glory</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;The Library of Congress has an online photography exhibit called &lt;a href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/boundforglory/glory-exhibit.html"&gt;Bound for Glory: America in Color, 1939-1943&lt;/a&gt; (thx, shay). The photos were a little low contrast, so I color corrected a few of them in Photoshop:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My goal was not to blow out the contrast or unnecessarily accentuate colors, but attempt to duplicate what these photos would look like had they been taken with a contemporary camera and processed using contemporary techniques and materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kottke.org/plus/misc/bound-for-glory/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/bound-for-glory/images/bfg-thumb.jpg" width="410" height="138" border="0" alt="Bound for Glory" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kottke.org/plus/misc/bound-for-glory/"&gt;Bound for Glory and Color Corrected &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>The Mill City Museum</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;In 1965, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washburn_%22A%22_Mill"&gt;the Washburn A mill&lt;/a&gt;, the last operating flour mill in Minneapolis, became also the last flour mill to close its doors, having been proceeded by an entire industry that, at one time, produced more flour than any other place in the U.S. The closure came when the mill's operating company, General Mills, moved its headquarters to Golden Valley, where real estate was plentiful and inexpensive. The area around St. Anthony Falls, the geological feature responsible for the beginnings of industry in the area, had long since fallen into general disrepair and it wasn't long before the Washburn A was deserted and inhabited by the homeless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The area started to show signs of life again in the 70s and 80s after being added to the &lt;a href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1971. Old mill buildings were converted for non-industrial business and residential use as people began to recognize the unique character and history of the area around the falls. In 1991, the Washburn A building burned and part of its structure collapsed, but firefighters saved the rest of the historic building from destruction. The remnants of the building and the adjacent grain elevators remained empty for years afterwards, save for the occasional graffiti artist and urban spelunker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I knew very little of this when I moved to the Twin Cities in 1996 and not much more when I left Minneapolis for San Francisco in 2000. Almost every weekday for two years I drove or pedaled past the shell of the Washburn A mill on the way to and from work on Washington Avenue in the warehouse district, where we manufactured web pages to fill a growing online space. Topped by the Gold Medal Flour sign, the mill became my favorite building in the Twin Cities, leading me to &lt;a href="http://www.0sil8.com/episodes/mpls_signs/goldmedal.html"&gt;include it in The Minneapolis Sign Project&lt;/a&gt; I did for 0sil8 shortly before I left for the West Coast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.0sil8.com/episodes/mpls_signs/goldmedal.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/goldmedalflour.jpg" width="420" height="233" alt="Gold Medal Flour sign on the grain elevators next to the Washburn A Mill, Minneapolis, MN" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seemed the perfect symbol of a time and industry long past, broken down but not entirely wiped away. I returned to visit Minneapolis occasionally and would drive past the Falls, wondering what would happen to my building, hoping against hope that they wouldn't eventually tear it down. With the structure in such bad shape, demolition seemed to be the only option.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, Meg and I spent a day in Minneapolis on our way to visit my parents in Wisconsin, my first stay in Mpls since mid-2002. Meg wanted to investigate running trails and I wanted to sneak a peek at the Gold Medal Flour Building (as I had taken to calling it), so we walked the three blocks to the river from our hotel, housed in the former Milwaukee Depot. The Gold Medal Flour sign was visible from several blocks away, so I knew they hadn't torn down the grain elevators, but it wasn't until I saw the shell of the Washburn A building peeking out around one of the other mill buildings that I knew it had been spared as well. As more of the building came into view, I saw a glass elevator rising from the ruins, backed by a glass facade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What the??!?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now practically running along the river in excitement and bewilderment, dragging poor Meg along with me in a preview of her jog the next morning, I saw a wooden boardwalk in front of the building and headed for what looked like the entrance. The burned out windows and broken glass remained; except for the elevator and the 8-story glass building sticking out the top, it looked much the same as it had after burning in 1991. I scrambled through the entrance and, lo, &lt;a href="http://www.millcitymuseum.org/"&gt;the Mill City Museum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/millcitymuseum.jpg" width="420" height="420" alt="Mill City Museum" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And what a museum. It was just closing when we got there, but we returned the next morning for a full tour of the museum and &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/maps/model/mill_ruins.html"&gt;the Mill Ruins Park&lt;/a&gt;. The highlight of the museum is an elevator tour of the mill as it was back in the early 20th century. They load 30 people at a time into a giant freight elevator, which takes the group up to the 8th floor of the museum, stopping at floors along the way to view and hear scenes from the mills workings, narrated by former mill workers. After the elevator tour, you're directed to an outdoor deck on the 9th floor, where you can view the shell of the mill building, St. Anthony Falls, the Stone Arch Bridge, the Gold Medal Flour sign, and the rest of the historic area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meyer, Scherer &amp;amp; Rockcastle are the architects &lt;a href="http://www.msrltd.com/ins1.html"&gt;responsible for the project&lt;/a&gt;, and they deserve all &lt;a href="http://www.millcitymuseum.org/about/awards.html"&gt;the accolades&lt;/a&gt; they get from one of the most unique museums I've ever been to. &lt;a href="http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/Fact-MillCity.pdf"&gt;The statement from the American Institute of Architects jury&lt;/a&gt; explains the design of the museum:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creative adaptive reuse of an extant shell of a mill building, with contrasting insertion of contemporary materials, weaving the old and the new into a seamless whole...A complex and intriguing social and regional story that reveals itself as the visitor progresses through the spaces. It is museum as a verb...A gutsy, crystalline, glowing courtyard for a reemerging waterfront district that attracts young and old and has stimulated adjacent development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I still can't quite believe they turned my favorite Minneapolis building (of all buildings) into a museum....and that it was done so well. More than anything, I'm happy and relieved that the Gold Medal Flour Building will always be there when I go back to visit. If you're ever in Minneapolis, do yourself a favor and check it out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/millcity/interesting"&gt;Photos on Flickr tagged "mill city"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/millcitymuseum/interesting/"&gt;Photos on Flickr tagged "mill city museum"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0873514467/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;Mill City: A Visual History of the Minneapolis Mill District&lt;/a&gt; was helpful in writing this post&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/02/AR2005090200846.html"&gt;A Washington Post review of the museum&lt;/a&gt; from September 2005&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.exploreminnesota.com/Guthrie_Moves_to_New_Theater_on_the_River.html"&gt;The new Guthrie Theater&lt;/a&gt; is right next door and is a dazzling building in its own right (&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alttext/203304812/"&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/guthrietheater/interesting/"&gt;more photos&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Through the viewfinder</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;I picked up &lt;a href="http://www.butkus.org/chinon/kodak_duraflex_ii/kodak_duraflex_ii.htm"&gt;a Kodak Duraflex II camera&lt;/a&gt; at an antique store this weekend. I'm going to use to it do some &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/throughtheviewfinder/interesting/"&gt;through the viewfinder&lt;/a&gt; shots with the D70. The idea is that you take a photo of the Duraflex viewfinder with the SLR camera, thereby picking up all the spots, scratches, and curves of the old lens. A lens hood is required to block unwanted light reflections. &lt;a href="http://www.russmorris.com/ttv/"&gt;Here's a tutorial describing the process&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, it was after I bought the Duraflex that I discovered the need for a different lens on the SLR to make it work properly. We'll see if the 50 mm lens at home works. Some results soon. Hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Tales of the telegraph</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;L.C. Hall wrote an article in 1902 for McClure's Magazine called &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph-office.com/pages/Telegraph_Talk-McClure-1902.html"&gt;"Telegraph Talk and Talkers, Human Character and Emotions an Old Telegrapher Reads on the Wire"&lt;/a&gt;. Hall's article reveals a surprisingly wide range of information transmitted across telegraph wires between operators that has nothing to do with the messages being sent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The piece begins with an account of a "fast sending tournament", which contest reveals not only the quick sender, but the masterful:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presently a fair-haired young man takes the chair, self confidence and reserve force in every gesture. Away he goes, and his transmission is as swift and pure as a mountain stream. "To guard against mistakes and delays, the sender of a message should order it repeated back." The audience, enthralled, forgets the speed, and hearkens only to the beauty of the sending. On and on fly the dots and dashes, and though it is clear that his pace is not up to that set by the leaders, nevertheless there is a finish -- an indefinable quality of perfection in the performance that at the end brings the multitude to its feet in a spontaneous burst of applause; such an outburst as might have greeted a great piece of oratory or acting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many friendships were formed over the wire between senders who, judging mainly by the cadence of the code, sized up their counterparts from hundreds of miles away to the point of knowing their gender and general demeanor despite having never asked. Hall struck up such a friendship with a man called C G, whose attachment to Morse and Hall was so strong that he called out for him on his deathbed:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Late in the evening," said the [head nurse] as our interview was ending, "I was called into his room. He was rapidly failing, and was talking as if in a dream, two fingers of his right hand tapping the bedclothes as if he were sending a message. I did not understand the purport, but perhaps you will. 'You say you can't read me?' he would say; 'then let H come to the key. He can read and understand me. Let H come there, please.' Now and again his fingers would cease moving, as if he were waiting for the right person to answer. Then he would go on once more: 'Dear me, dear me, this will never do! I want to talk with H. I have an important message for him. Please tell him to hurry.' Then would follow another pause, during which he would murmur to himself regretfully. But at last he suddenly assumed the manner of one listening intently; then, his face breaking into a smile, he cried, his fingers keeping time with his words: 'Is that you, H? I'm so glad you've come! I have a message for you.' And so, his fingers tapping out an unspoken message, his kindly spirit took its flight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The article closes with a bit on telegraph slang, or "hog-Morse", when inexperienced operators slip up and send a bit of jibberish that expert receivers can nonetheless decipher from the context.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the patois of the wires "pot" means "hot," "foot" is rendered "fool," "U. S. Navy" is "us nasty," "home" is changed to "hog," and so on. If, for example, while receiving a telegram, a user of the patois should miss a word and say to you "6naz fimme q," the expert would know that he meant "Please fill me in." But there is no difficulty about the interpretation of the patois provided the receiver be experienced and always on the alert. When, however, the mind wanders in receiving, there is always danger that the hand will record exactly what the ear dictates. On one occasion, at Christmas time, a hilarious citizen of Rome, New York, telegraphed a friend at a distance a message which reached its destination reading, "Cog hog to rog and wemm pave a bumy tig." It looked to the man addressed like Choctaw, and of course was not understood. Upon being repeated, it read, "Come home to Rome, and we'll have a bully time." Another case of confusion wrought by hog-Morse was that of the Richmond, Virginia, commission firm, who were requested by wire to quote the price on a carload of "undressed slaves." The member of the firm who receipted for the telegram being something of a wag, wired back: "No trade in naked chattel since Emancipation Proclamation." The original message had been transmitted by senders of hog-Morse, called technically "hams," and the receivers had absent-mindedly recorded the words as they had really sounded. What the inquirer wanted, of course, was a quotation on a carload of staves in the rough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hog-Morse reminds me of the SMS typos which occur when T9 slips up or someone fat-fingers the wrong button on the phone. I can't recall how many times I've texted my wife "good soon", by which I meant that I'll be "home" shortly. It's also reminiscent of gamer &lt;a href="http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/citations/typo_slang_1/"&gt;typo slang&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn"&gt;pwned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teh"&gt;teh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=su%5B"&gt;su[&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more on the telegraph, particularly as it relates to contemporary communication technology, I highly recommend &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425171698/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;The Victorian Internet&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.tomstandage.com"&gt;Tom Standage&lt;/a&gt;.

And in an Australian speed contest, &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-2-1571664,00.html"&gt;a telegraph operator beat texting teens&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Inline audio</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Last week, Vanity Fair published &lt;a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/features/general/060801fege01"&gt;an article about the U.S. Air Force's response to 9/11&lt;/a&gt;. In writing the article, Michael Bronner makes extensive use of audio tapes from the control room of NORAD's Northeast headquarters and in the online version, you can listen to audio clips of those tapes. As you can see in the screenshot below, not only are the transcripts of the audio part of the main narrative (and not collected elsewhere or put into a separate footnote or sidebar), but the controls for playing the audio clips (&lt;span style="color:#ff0000;"&gt;PLAY&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span style="color:#ff0000;"&gt;STOP&lt;/span&gt;) are presented inline as well:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/vanity-play.gif" width="420" height="327" alt="Inline audio on Vanity Fair" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's a nice bit of design. No need for a clunky player or to download the clips at the end of the article when two simple text-only inline commands will do. In &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961392177/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;Beautiful Evidence&lt;/a&gt;, Edward Tufte argues for the placement of information in the location where it will do the most good for those attempting to understand the matter at hand, regardless of form:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence is evidence, whether words numbers, images, diagrams, still or moving. It is all information after all. For readers and viewers, the intellectual task remains constant regardless of the particular mode of evidence: to understand and to reason about the materials at hand, and to appraise their quality, relevance, and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The examples that Tufte cites in the book are all visual and published on paper. This is an instance where web publishing provides for a better way to design for the information at hand than print. (thx to &lt;a href="http://lightningfield.com/"&gt;david&lt;/a&gt; for kickstarting this post)&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>How I Blog</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Seth Godin, who ruminates for a living, &lt;a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/09/what_makes_an_i.html"&gt;wrote a little something about how ideas are transmitted last year&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an idea to spread, it needs to be sent and received.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one "sends" an idea unless:&lt;br /&gt; a. they understand it&lt;br /&gt; b. they want it to spread&lt;br /&gt; c. they believe that spreading it will enhance their power (reputation, income, friendships) or their peace of mind&lt;br /&gt; d. the effort necessary to send the idea is less than the benefits&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one "gets" an idea unless:&lt;br /&gt; a. the first impression demands further investigation&lt;br /&gt; b. they already understand the foundation ideas necessary to get the new idea&lt;br /&gt; c. they trust or respect the sender enough to invest the time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seth hits the nail right on the head with this. When I'm deciding what links to post here, I'm essentially curating ideas, collecting them to "send" to you (and to myself, in a way). And unconsciously, these seven points factor into my decision on what to post here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a. they understand it&lt;/strong&gt; - I read everything I post and attempt to understand an article enough to represent it accurately when linking to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b. they want it to spread&lt;/strong&gt; - I pick links and write posts based on ideas that I think are in some way important, meaningful, relevent, or good for the soul. And sure, I want those ideas to be more widely known or enjoyed, even if it's something as simple as someone getting a needed chuckle from &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4aPGtx7e6k"&gt;a video of a monkey teasing a dog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c. they believe that spreading it will enhance their power (reputation, income, friendships) or their peace of mind&lt;/strong&gt; - This factors into anyone's motivations for anything. In George Orwell's 1947 essay &lt;a href="http://www.k-1.com/Orwell/index.cgi/work/essays/write.html"&gt;Why I Write&lt;/a&gt;, his #1 reason is "sheer egoism".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;d. the effort necessary to send the idea is less than the benefits&lt;/strong&gt; - If I wanted to, I could post 30 links or more a day without too much more effort on my part, but in this case, part of sending the idea is making sure the reader has enough attention to consider it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a. the first impression demands further investigation&lt;/strong&gt; - I spend a lot of time on getting the description of some linked text, photo, or video just right, so that the reader has a good idea of what they're getting into. Choosing a 1-2 sentence pull-quote that accurately represents the idea of an article is key in getting people's attention in a productive way. "This is an awesome link" is only going to cut it so many times; you need to tell people what the link is and give people an honest reason to click.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b. they already understand the foundation ideas necessary to get the new idea&lt;/strong&gt; - I assume visitors to the site are regular readers and that they have a good sense of what happens here, but I try to limit my reliance on jargon or "in-crowd" references so that everyone can follow along.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c. they trust or respect the sender enough to invest the time&lt;/strong&gt; - If I do all that other stuff right, hopefully you'll trust me enough to be receptive to the ideas I'm sending you. And if not, you probably won't trust me for long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like I said, all this was pretty much happening unconsciously. I've worked consciously on bits and pieces of it, but until I read Seth's post, I didn't know that this was the end-to-end process.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Web 2.0, a definition of sorts</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;37signals recently polled the customers of their online project management application and &lt;a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/what_web_20_means_to_500_random_basecamp_customers.php"&gt;one of the questions asked what Web 2.0 meant to them&lt;/a&gt;. They've posted &lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/web2-500.html"&gt;500 answers to that question&lt;/a&gt; on their site; it's an interesting read. I decided to do a quick and dirty analysis of the most frequently used words by the respondents, hoping that the result would provide a collective definition of sorts for the term Web 2.0. By the time I'd finished (with several timeouts and distractive blog-related detours), I went back to the thread and saw that &lt;a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/what_web_20_means_to_500_random_basecamp_customers.php#c35607"&gt;Jacob Kaplan-Moss had already completed an analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Here are his top 15 words:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;web - 348&lt;br /&gt;ajax - 107&lt;br /&gt;applications - 93&lt;br /&gt;new - 78&lt;br /&gt;user - 71&lt;br /&gt;apps - 44&lt;br /&gt;desktop - 40&lt;br /&gt;sites - 37&lt;br /&gt;people - 36&lt;br /&gt;internet - 36&lt;br /&gt;content - 34&lt;br /&gt;think - 33&lt;br /&gt;software - 31&lt;br /&gt;services - 30&lt;br /&gt;technologies - 29&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just for kicks, here's my top 30:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;web: 347&lt;br /&gt; ajax: 105&lt;br /&gt; more: 99&lt;br /&gt; applications: 92&lt;br /&gt; new: 77&lt;br /&gt; user: 69&lt;br /&gt; use: 47&lt;br /&gt; apps: 43&lt;br /&gt; desktop: 39&lt;br /&gt; sites: 38&lt;br /&gt; internet: 35&lt;br /&gt; people: 35&lt;br /&gt; content: 33&lt;br /&gt; think: 32&lt;br /&gt; software: 30&lt;br /&gt; using: 30&lt;br /&gt; etc: 29&lt;br /&gt; services: 29&lt;br /&gt; next: 28&lt;br /&gt; technologies: 28&lt;br /&gt; interactive: 28&lt;br /&gt; generation: 27&lt;br /&gt; application: 25&lt;br /&gt; marketing: 25&lt;br /&gt; websites: 23&lt;br /&gt; better: 23&lt;br /&gt; social: 23&lt;br /&gt; users: 22&lt;br /&gt; hype: 22&lt;br /&gt; buzzword: 21&lt;br /&gt; interfaces: 20&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some reason (my shoddy programming skills are a likely culprit), my word counts are slightly different than Jacob's, but they're close. I also left in a few words that he removed but that I thought were relevant, like "more", "use", "using", and "etc". Here are a few more interesting words and their frequency counts:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;community: 17&lt;br /&gt; collaboration: 13&lt;br /&gt; companies: 13&lt;br /&gt; bubble: 10&lt;br /&gt; ruby: 9&lt;br /&gt; rounded: 9&lt;br /&gt; gradients: 8&lt;br /&gt; rails: 7&lt;br /&gt; 37signals: 6&lt;br /&gt; tagging: 6&lt;br /&gt; flickr: 5&lt;br /&gt; wikis: 5&lt;br /&gt; overused: 5&lt;br /&gt; o'reilly: 5&lt;br /&gt; hyped: 5&lt;br /&gt; overhyped: 5&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not sure this provides much of a definition, but it's fun to play around with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big ol' obvious caveat:&lt;/b&gt; I performed a straight-up word frequency analysis which did not take into account the context of particular words (e.g. no distinction between different uses of words like "think": "I think Web 2.0 sucks" and "Web 2.0 products make users think"), phrase frequency ("web 2.0", "next generation", "rounded corners"), or anything like that. This obviously limits the utility of the analysis; hence "quick and dirty".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps a better "definition" of Web 2.0 comes from &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/web2.0"&gt;the related tags at del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ajax&lt;br /&gt; tools&lt;br /&gt; web&lt;br /&gt; blog&lt;br /&gt; webdesign&lt;br /&gt; software&lt;br /&gt; design&lt;br /&gt; social&lt;br /&gt; programming&lt;br /&gt; javascript&lt;br /&gt; business&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not bad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/11/there_has_been_.html"&gt;del.icio.us did this analysis back in November 2005&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Nordic geopolitics</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Heading into dinner last night, I believed with certainty that Finland was one of the Scandinavian countries. I rebuffed &lt;a href="http://www.blackbeltjones.com/work/"&gt;Mr. Jones'&lt;/a&gt; attempts to disabuse me of that notion before dessert arrived, but it wasn't until this morning that I checked into the matter and found that he may be correct.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Minneapolis Star Tribune &lt;a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:R80mGVFnAXsJ:www.startribune.com/161/story/182459.html+finland+scandinavia&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4"&gt;investigated the issue back in January&lt;/a&gt;, finding that there's some controversy, even among the staff at the Finnish Embassy in Washington D.C.:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I called the Finnish Embassy in Washington, D.C., where press aide Mari Poyhtari started by saying Finland is part of Scandinavia, but then someone in the background disagreed and she corrected herself. The most accurate term is Fenno-Scandinavia or the Nordic countries, Poyhtari said. But, she admitted, "We always say we're part of Scandinavia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia"&gt;The Wikipedia page on Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;, the result of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Scandinavia"&gt;a vigorous discussion&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, indicates that there are several possible arrangements of Scandinavian countries, depending on the grouping criteria used and who you're talking to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Geographically, the Scandinavian peninsula includes mainland Norway, Sweden, and part of Finland.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the region, the common definition includes Norway, Denmark, and Sweden.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outside of the region, the term often includes not only Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland but also Iceland, a grouping commonly called the Nordic countries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linguistically speaking (pardon the pun), the Finnish language is unrelated to Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish, which is an argument for the cultural exclusion of Finland from Scandinavia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;So there you go, clear as mud. Probably best to avoid the issue altogether in the future by using the term Nordic instead of Scandinavian. &lt;a href="http://www.alllooksame.com/"&gt;All look same&lt;/a&gt; anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://underbelly-buce.blogspot.com/2006/08/who-is-scandinavian.html"&gt;Underbelly notes&lt;/a&gt; that this "issue is in no way limited to Scandinavians":&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;It's the kind of muddiness you just have to expect when you consider any culture. Was Cleopatra an Egyptian? Are the Tasmanians British? What did the Byzanatines have in mind when they described themselves as "The Romans" while fighting wars against, well, Rome?&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(thx, jack)&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Gopher still going</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_protocol"&gt;Gopher&lt;/a&gt;, developed in 1991 at the University of Minnesota, is a text-only, hierarchical document search and retrieval protocol that was supplanted by the more flexible WWW in the mid-1990s. Some servers running this old protocol are still alive, however. The WELL, an online discussion board and community that started back in 1985, is still running a Gopher server. If you've got a recent version of Firefox, you can check it out in its original Gopher-y state at &lt;a href="gopher://gopher.well.com/"&gt;gopher://gopher.well.com/&lt;/a&gt; or with any web browser at &lt;a href="http://gopher.well.com:70/"&gt;http://gopher.well.com:70/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems to have been frozen in early 1996 or so and houses several historical documents from the early 1990s. Many of the links are dead and some documents cannot be found, but poking around for 20 minutes or so, I found:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.com:70/0/matrix/internet/hobbes.internet.timeline"&gt;1994 edition of Hobbes' Internet Timeline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/"&gt;The current version is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/1/Publications/MONDO"&gt;Interviews from MONDO 2000&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/0/Publications/MONDO/william.txt"&gt;William Vollman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/0/Publications/MONDO/laurel.txt"&gt;Brenda Laurel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/0/Publications/MONDO/byr-lear.txt"&gt;a conversation between David Byrne and Timothy Leary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.com:70/1/Communications/2001"&gt;Scripts from a 1993 program on NBC called Almost 2001&lt;/a&gt;, "a 5-part series on Telecommunications and Technology".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.com:70/0/Communications/Highways_of_the_Mind.txt"&gt;Highways of the Mind&lt;/a&gt;, an essay by Roger Karraker from 1991 on the future of technology and globally networked humanity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.com:70/0/Community/gaskins.farm"&gt;A 1972 article by then-journalist Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; about the leader of a communal settlement in Tennessee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.com:70/0/Community/small.town"&gt;A profile and history of The WELL&lt;/a&gt; from September 1993.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/1/Publications/authors"&gt;Some miscellaneous writings&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/1/Publications/authors/Sterling"&gt;some stuff by Bruce Sterling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the articles by Sterling, &lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/0/Publications/authors/Sterling/cfp4"&gt;his remarks from a privacy conference in 1994&lt;/a&gt;, touches on a topic that's still hotly debated today:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been asked to explain why I don't worry much about the topics of privacy threat raised by this panel. And I don't. One reason is that these scenarios seem to assume that there will be large, monolithic bureaucracies (of whatever character, political or economic) that are capable of harnessing computers for one-way surveillance of an unsuspecting populace. I've come to feel that computation just doesn't work that way. Being afraid of monolithic organizations especially when they have computers, is like being afraid of really big gorillas especially when they are on fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don't follow Sterling's writing that closely, but I wonder if he's changed his mind on this issue?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matisse Enzer helped set up The WELL's Gopher server and &lt;a href="http://twoalpha.blogspot.com/2006/04/well-gopher.html"&gt;tells how it came to be on his blog&lt;/a&gt;. And here are a few other Gopher servers that are still running:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gopher://aerv.nl/1"&gt;gopher://aerv.nl/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="gopher://hal3000.cx/1"&gt;gopher://hal3000.cx/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="gopher://quux.org/1"&gt;gopher://quux.org/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="gopher://sdf.lonestar.org/11/users"&gt;gopher://sdf.lonestar.org/11/users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://gopherproject.org/Software/Gopher"&gt;http://gopherproject.org/Software/Gopher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; It occurs to me that this might be up the alley of Digg's users. If you've got an account there, you may wish to &lt;a href="http://digg.com/hardware/Gopher_servers_still_online"&gt;Digg this story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/util/gopher/gophercon1.txt"&gt;Here's a write-up of GopherCon '92&lt;/a&gt;, "a small working session of Gopher developers and users". I liked this bit:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed Vielmetti of CICnet gave a talk on "what we would be gathering to discuss if UMinn had never developed Gopher", meaning primarily World-Wide Web (WWW). WWW was developed for the high-energy physics community and serves as a model of what Gopher could do if a discipline-oriented virtual community invested in it heavily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks for sending that along, &lt;a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/"&gt;Ed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/"&gt;The archives of the infamous spies.com Gopher server appear to be here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Baseball card days</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Dave Jamieson used to collect baseball cards and &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2146218"&gt;recently uncovered his stash&lt;/a&gt; when he cleaned out the closet of his childhood home. In attempting to recoup some of the time and money spent in his youth on this cardboard, Jamieson found that baseball cards aren't as popular or as lucrative as they used to be:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baseball cards peaked in popularity in the early 1990s. They've taken a long slide into irrelevance ever since, last year logging less than a quarter of the sales they did in 1991. Baseball card shops, once roughly 10,000 strong in the United States, have dwindled to about 1,700. A lot of dealers who didn't get out of the game took a beating. "They all put product in their basement and thought it was gonna turn into gold," Alan Rosen, the dealer with the self-bestowed moniker "Mr. Mint," told me. Rosen says one dealer he knows recently struggled to unload a cache of 7,000 Mike Mussina rookie cards. He asked for 25 cents apiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Close readers of kottke.org know that I collected sports cards too. I got involved in this prepubescent hobby later than most; I was 14 or 15 when a friend and his older brother -- who was around 24 and collecting for investment -- introduced me to it. &lt;a href="http://www.kottke.org/01/04/i-have-an-embarrassing-admission"&gt;And I loved it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still have them all somewhere, in boxes, collecting dust faster than value. The Ken Griffey Jr. Upper Deck rookie, the 130 different Nolan Ryan cards, the complete 1989 Hoops set (with the David Robinson rookie), and several others I really can't remember right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to spend untold hours sifting through them, looking up the values in Beckett's Price Guide, visiting card shops, flipping through commons to complete sets, looking for patterns in Topps' rack packs (I scored many a Jim Abbott rookie with this technique), chewing that ancient bubble gum (I bought a pack of 1983 cards once and chewed the gum...it was horrible), and keeping track of the total value of my collection with a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet on my dad's 286. It was a lot of fun at the time (as the Web is fun for me now); I guess that's about all one can ask for from a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recently I stumbled across &lt;a href="http://baseballcardblog.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Baseball Card Blog&lt;/a&gt; and was hit by a giant wave of nostalgia for my old obsession. One thing led to another -- you know how that goes -- and before I knew it, a package was speeding its way to me from a card shop in Pennsylvania containing several 1989 Fleer &amp;amp; Donruss wax packs, a 1989 Topps rack pack, and a couple of 1987 Topps wax packs.&lt;sup id="t0725061"&gt;&lt;a href="#f0725061"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've been opening a pack every few days since they arrived. Smell is the sense most powerfully associated with memory, so getting a whiff of that cardboard is really sending me back. Like a wine connoisseur, I can even smell the difference between each brand of card; the smell of Topps cards holds the strongest memories for me...the 1989 Topps set was my favorite. I opened the '87 Topps packs with &lt;a href="http://hello.typepad.com"&gt;a fellow ex-collector&lt;/a&gt;, but when we tried to chew the gum, it tasted like the cards and turned to a muddy dust in our mouths. But that was mostly what happened even when the gum was new, so we were unsurprised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of the aforementioned slump in the baseball card collecting economy, the card packs I ordered were the same price I paid for them as a kid (factoring for inflation), even though they're almost 20 years old and way more scarce. Back then, I used most of my $5/week allowance on cards, and it took weeks and months of patience to buy enough packs to complete a set, procure that Griffey rookie card, or amass enough Mark McGwires to trade to a friend for a desired Nolan Ryan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an adult, I have the cashflow to buy any card I want whenever I want (within reason). Or several boxes of cards, so as to compile complete sets instantly. Or I can just purchase the complete sets and skip the intermediate step. I could buy an entire box of 1989 Upper Deck packs -- at $1.25 per pack and nearly impossible to find in rural Wisconsin, an unimaginable extravagance for me as a kid -- &lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/1989-Upper-Deck-Low-Baseball-Wax-Box-Ken-Griffey-Jr-R_W0QQitemZ290011848348QQihZ019QQcategoryZ70380QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem"&gt;right now on eBay&lt;/a&gt;. When I think about the financial advantages I now have over my 16-yo self in collecting the same exact cards, I feel like the NY Yankees (and their &lt;a href="http://benfry.com/salaryper/"&gt;monster payroll&lt;/a&gt;) competing in a Single A league. It's unfair and even thinking about collecting cards in that manner takes a lot of the fun out of it for me. If I do start collecting cards again, I'm going to approach it like I did back then: by hand, a little at a time, and treating even the essentially worthless commons with care. Unless Nolan Ryan is involved...in that case, &lt;a href="http://www.homeruncards.com/rookiecards/nolan-ryan-rookie-card.shtml"&gt;the sky's the limit&lt;/a&gt;, although I might have to sell my bicycle to get it. In the meantime, I'm waiting for the next household footwear purchase so I can put my newly purchased cards in the shoe box for safe keeping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="f0725061"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[1] A quick note on terminology. A "wax pack" is a basic pack of around 15 cards (plus gum, when cards still had gum packaged with them), so-called because the packages used to be sealed with wax. (Now they're all probably packaged in plastic and whatnot...I don't know, I haven't kept up.) The bottom card in such a pack is called a "wax back" because the card got a thin layer of wax on it from the sealing process. A "rack pack" is a hanging triple pack made of see-thru plastic. A "common" is an ordinary card not worth very much, as opposed to cards or rookies, hot prospects, all-stars, and the like. A "box" contains several wax packs, typically 20-40 packs/box. A "complete set" is a collection of every card sold by a company in a particular year. The '89 Topps set had 792 cards. Sets were sold in factory-sealed boxes or were compiled by hand from cards acquired in packs. &lt;a href="#t0725061"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Beautiful Evidence by Edward R. Tufte</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Beautiful Evidence is both the title of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961392177/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;Edward Tufte's latest book&lt;/a&gt; and an accurate description of the document itself. Like few other mass market publications, BE is lovingly hand-crafted, a physical manifestation of the ideas expressed in its pages; the text and images therein could be about another subject entirely and you might still get the point: "Words, Numbers, Images - Together" (the title of the book's fourth chapter).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Case in point. Pages 123 and 124 fold out into a spread depicting &lt;a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/minard"&gt;Charles Joseph Minard's famous infographic&lt;/a&gt; of the disastrous 1812 invasion of Russia by France. But unlike most magazine and book fold-outs, the page that folds out is cut 1/2 inch narrower than the underlying page so that a) a bit of the page underneath peeks out, providing a visual cue for unfoldability, and b) there's no difficulty when you go to refold the page with getting it caught in the book's crease or otherwise undesirably bending/creasing it. The fold-out design is a small thing that the casual reader might not even notice, but it demonstrates the care that went into the production of the book (and perhaps the reason why Tufte took so long in writing/designing it).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gang at 37signals &lt;a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/fly_on_the_wall_the_magic_is_that_everything_has_a_center_of_gravity_you_just_need_to_find_it.php"&gt;noticed similar craftsmanship in the writing and presentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What struck me is how you almost never have to hold something in your head while turning the page...he usually finishes his thought within the two pages you can see...and when you flip, it's something new...that's an excellent self-imposed constraint...'whatever i need to say, i'll do it here.'" Jason replied, "Yes, I love that. I noticed that more on this book than others. The image and text is in one spread so when you turn you are turning your attention to a new idea. If you have too much to say than the space allowed then you are probably saying too much...it definitely makes it easier to design the book too...you can design each spread as if it was a standalone poster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I've also noticed about Beautiful Evidence is the lack of reviews in mainstream publications; I can't find a single newspaper or magazine that has published a review. Compare that to the releases of Gladwell's Blink, Remnick's Reporting, and Anderson's The Long Tail, for which reviews started appearing almost everywhere before the books were even available. Those books were written for mass audiences and backed by large publishing companies with ample PR resources and plenty of review copies to go around. In contrast, Beautiful Evidence is self-published by Tufte, which means it's beautiful, personal, and done just right, but also invisible to the mainstream press. Not that Beautiful Evidence is being ignored -- &lt;a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=%22beautiful+evidence%22"&gt;the blogosphere is talking about it&lt;/a&gt; and the Amazon Sales Rank is currently about 600 (which doesn't count online sales &lt;a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be"&gt;directly from edwardtufte.com&lt;/a&gt;) -- but it deserves the consideration of the mainstream press.&lt;/p&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961392177/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;View @ Amazon&lt;/a&gt;)</summary>

      <title>Ding-a-ling circus</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;One of the first reviews Ruth Reichl wrote as the New York Times food critic was of Le Cirque, a fancy French restaurant in midtown Manhattan. In &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DA1039F93AA15753C1A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;the now-famous piece&lt;/a&gt;, immortalied in her memoir, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594200319/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;Garlic and Sapphires&lt;/a&gt;, Reichl compares the service she receives at the restaurant as a welcomed reviewer with that as an average Jane. From &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DA1039F93AA15753C1A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;the review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of five months I ate five meals at the restaurant; it was not until the fourth that the owner, Sirio Maccioni, figured out who I was. When I was discovered, the change was startling. Everything improved: the seating, the service, the size of the portions. We had already reached dessert, but our little plate of petit fours was whisked away to be replaced by a larger, more ostentatious one. An avalanche of sweets descended upon the table, and I was fascinated to note that the raspberries on the new desserts were three times the size of those on the old ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thirteen years later, current food critic Frank Bruni &lt;a href="http://events.nytimes.com/2006/07/19/dining/reviews/19rest.html?ei=5090&amp;en=0f42fca6575221f7&amp;ex=1310961600&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;reviews the newest incarnation of Le Cirque in today's Times&lt;/a&gt; and echoing Reichl's technique, finds that little has changed:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also experienced Le Cirque's famously split personality, half dismissive and half pampering, depending on who you are. On my first visit, when a companion and I arrived before the two other members of our party, a host let us know we should wait in the bar area not by asking or telling us to go there but by gesturing silently in that direction with his head. Most of the seats were occupied, so we stood. Over the next 10 minutes, no one asked us if we wanted a drink or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After we were taken to our table, servers seemed to figure out who I was and offered to move us to prime real estate with better sightlines. (We declined.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So on a subsequent visit I sent three friends in ahead of me. One sat at the bar for 15 minutes without getting a server's attention, and a bartender quarreled with the two others when they asked that the charges for their Champagne be transferred to the table. At a place as self-consciously posh as Le Cirque, such a request should be granted instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was treated like royalty when I showed up, and on another night, when I dined with a filmmaker whom the staff also knew, soft-shell crabs, which weren't on the menu, appeared almost as soon as she mentioned an appetite for them. They were fantastic: crunchy, meaty, sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can't imagine wanting to go someplace like that when there's so many other places with food as good or better and where the service is friendly, helpful, and accommodating for everybody. I guess that's the side of New York I don't like.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out smackdown</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Here it is, the awful truth. After sampling &lt;a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/"&gt;In-N-Out Burger&lt;/a&gt; twice this past weekend (a cheeseburger with raw onion and, 4 days later, a Double Double w/ no onions) and having had several &lt;a href="http://shakeshacknyc.com"&gt;Shack Burgers&lt;/a&gt; this year (my most recent one was a couple of weeks ago), an adequate comparison between the two can be made. The verdict?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Shake Shack burger wins in a landslide. It's more flavorful, features a better balance of ingredients, and a yummier bun. On the french fries front, In-N-Out's fresh-cut fries get the nod.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Courtesy of &lt;a href="http://mena.vox.com/"&gt;Mena&lt;/a&gt;, something to keep in mind: a cheeseburger at In-N-Out is $1.85 while a similarly appointed Shack Burger is $4.38, almost 2.5 times as much. SS french fries are nearly twice the price of In-N-Out fries. The burger comparison is an unfair one because, despite its location and style, Shake Shack is a restaurant and In-N-Out is a fast food joint. That the burgers are even close enough to compare -- and make no mistake, I still love the In-N-Out burger -- says a great deal about In-N-Out.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;During the depths of the dot com bust, &lt;a href="http://www.juliandibbell.com/"&gt;Julian Dibbell&lt;/a&gt; looked online for a job and found one as a commodities trader in the Ultima Online virtual world. During one particularly productive month, he made almost US$4000. Dibbell has a book coming out about the experience, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465015352/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;Play Money: Or, How I Quit My Day Job and Made Millions Trading Virtual Loot&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to being available at bookstores in meatspace, Play Money will also be on sale in the virtual world of Second Life in the currency of that world (Linden dollars). From the press release:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-game versions of Play Money designed by Second Life coder/publisher Falk Bergman are available for L$750. These copies can be signed by Dibbell at his in-Second Life interview with journalist Wagner James Au on July 27th. For the Second Life resident who needs something a bit more tactile, L$6250 buys a real-life copy of Play Money, shipped with care to the buyer's real life address, in addition to the standard in-game version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(At the time of this press release, Linden dollars are trading at approximately L$300.00 to the US$1.00. Adjusted to US dollars, an online copy costs US$2.50, and the price of a real-life copy bought in-game is around US$20.85.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dibbell will be &lt;a href="http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2006/07/julian_dibbell_.html"&gt;signing his virtual books&lt;/a&gt; in Second Life on July 27th. Caterina read Play Money and &lt;a href="http://www.caterina.net/archive/000993.html"&gt;has some thoughts on its relation to her work/play at Ludicorp&lt;/a&gt;. And here's a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho5Yxe6UVv4"&gt;preview of Chinese Gold Farmers&lt;/a&gt;, a documentary on &lt;a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3141815"&gt;gold farming sweatshops&lt;/a&gt; in China.&lt;/p&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465015352/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;View @ Amazon&lt;/a&gt;)</summary>

      <title>Taste3 conference</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to attend &lt;a href="http://www.taste3.com"&gt;the Taste3 conference&lt;/a&gt; in Napa Valley, CA over the weekend. What a nice change from technology conferences. Instead of software demo CDs in the schwag bags, there were bottles of wine and chocolate and instead of BOF gatherings on podcasting, there were dinners with fine wine and yummy cheese. As you would expect, the folks in the hospitality industry are a lot more outgoing than the nerds; except for me, there was a distinct lack of people standing in corners looking down at their shoes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the next few days I'll be posting some thoughts and links from the conference; I hope they'll be as interesting as the conference was.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Bound for Glory</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;The Library of Congress has an online photography exhibit called &lt;a href="http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/boundforglory/glory-exhibit.html"&gt;Bound for Glory: America in Color, 1939-1943&lt;/a&gt; (thx, shay). The photos were a little low contrast, so I color corrected a few of them in Photoshop:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My goal was not to blow out the contrast or unnecessarily accentuate colors, but attempt to duplicate what these photos would look like had they been taken with a contemporary camera and processed using contemporary techniques and materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kottke.org/plus/misc/bound-for-glory/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/bound-for-glory/images/bfg-thumb.jpg" width="410" height="138" border="0" alt="Bound for Glory" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kottke.org/plus/misc/bound-for-glory/"&gt;Bound for Glory and Color Corrected &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>The Mill City Museum</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;In 1965, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washburn_%22A%22_Mill"&gt;the Washburn A mill&lt;/a&gt;, the last operating flour mill in Minneapolis, became also the last flour mill to close its doors, having been proceeded by an entire industry that, at one time, produced more flour than any other place in the U.S. The closure came when the mill's operating company, General Mills, moved its headquarters to Golden Valley, where real estate was plentiful and inexpensive. The area around St. Anthony Falls, the geological feature responsible for the beginnings of industry in the area, had long since fallen into general disrepair and it wasn't long before the Washburn A was deserted and inhabited by the homeless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The area started to show signs of life again in the 70s and 80s after being added to the &lt;a href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/"&gt;National Register of Historic Places&lt;/a&gt; in 1971. Old mill buildings were converted for non-industrial business and residential use as people began to recognize the unique character and history of the area around the falls. In 1991, the Washburn A building burned and part of its structure collapsed, but firefighters saved the rest of the historic building from destruction. The remnants of the building and the adjacent grain elevators remained empty for years afterwards, save for the occasional graffiti artist and urban spelunker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I knew very little of this when I moved to the Twin Cities in 1996 and not much more when I left Minneapolis for San Francisco in 2000. Almost every weekday for two years I drove or pedaled past the shell of the Washburn A mill on the way to and from work on Washington Avenue in the warehouse district, where we manufactured web pages to fill a growing online space. Topped by the Gold Medal Flour sign, the mill became my favorite building in the Twin Cities, leading me to &lt;a href="http://www.0sil8.com/episodes/mpls_signs/goldmedal.html"&gt;include it in The Minneapolis Sign Project&lt;/a&gt; I did for 0sil8 shortly before I left for the West Coast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.0sil8.com/episodes/mpls_signs/goldmedal.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/goldmedalflour.jpg" width="420" height="233" alt="Gold Medal Flour sign on the grain elevators next to the Washburn A Mill, Minneapolis, MN" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seemed the perfect symbol of a time and industry long past, broken down but not entirely wiped away. I returned to visit Minneapolis occasionally and would drive past the Falls, wondering what would happen to my building, hoping against hope that they wouldn't eventually tear it down. With the structure in such bad shape, demolition seemed to be the only option.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, Meg and I spent a day in Minneapolis on our way to visit my parents in Wisconsin, my first stay in Mpls since mid-2002. Meg wanted to investigate running trails and I wanted to sneak a peek at the Gold Medal Flour Building (as I had taken to calling it), so we walked the three blocks to the river from our hotel, housed in the former Milwaukee Depot. The Gold Medal Flour sign was visible from several blocks away, so I knew they hadn't torn down the grain elevators, but it wasn't until I saw the shell of the Washburn A building peeking out around one of the other mill buildings that I knew it had been spared as well. As more of the building came into view, I saw a glass elevator rising from the ruins, backed by a glass facade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What the??!?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now practically running along the river in excitement and bewilderment, dragging poor Meg along with me in a preview of her jog the next morning, I saw a wooden boardwalk in front of the building and headed for what looked like the entrance. The burned out windows and broken glass remained; except for the elevator and the 8-story glass building sticking out the top, it looked much the same as it had after burning in 1991. I scrambled through the entrance and, lo, &lt;a href="http://www.millcitymuseum.org/"&gt;the Mill City Museum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/millcitymuseum.jpg" width="420" height="420" alt="Mill City Museum" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And what a museum. It was just closing when we got there, but we returned the next morning for a full tour of the museum and &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/maps/model/mill_ruins.html"&gt;the Mill Ruins Park&lt;/a&gt;. The highlight of the museum is an elevator tour of the mill as it was back in the early 20th century. They load 30 people at a time into a giant freight elevator, which takes the group up to the 8th floor of the museum, stopping at floors along the way to view and hear scenes from the mills workings, narrated by former mill workers. After the elevator tour, you're directed to an outdoor deck on the 9th floor, where you can view the shell of the mill building, St. Anthony Falls, the Stone Arch Bridge, the Gold Medal Flour sign, and the rest of the historic area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meyer, Scherer &amp;amp; Rockcastle are the architects &lt;a href="http://www.msrltd.com/ins1.html"&gt;responsible for the project&lt;/a&gt;, and they deserve all &lt;a href="http://www.millcitymuseum.org/about/awards.html"&gt;the accolades&lt;/a&gt; they get from one of the most unique museums I've ever been to. &lt;a href="http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/Fact-MillCity.pdf"&gt;The statement from the American Institute of Architects jury&lt;/a&gt; explains the design of the museum:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A creative adaptive reuse of an extant shell of a mill building, with contrasting insertion of contemporary materials, weaving the old and the new into a seamless whole...A complex and intriguing social and regional story that reveals itself as the visitor progresses through the spaces. It is museum as a verb...A gutsy, crystalline, glowing courtyard for a reemerging waterfront district that attracts young and old and has stimulated adjacent development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I still can't quite believe they turned my favorite Minneapolis building (of all buildings) into a museum....and that it was done so well. More than anything, I'm happy and relieved that the Gold Medal Flour Building will always be there when I go back to visit. If you're ever in Minneapolis, do yourself a favor and check it out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/millcity/interesting"&gt;Photos on Flickr tagged "mill city"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/millcitymuseum/interesting/"&gt;Photos on Flickr tagged "mill city museum"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0873514467/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;Mill City: A Visual History of the Minneapolis Mill District&lt;/a&gt; was helpful in writing this post&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/02/AR2005090200846.html"&gt;A Washington Post review of the museum&lt;/a&gt; from September 2005&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.exploreminnesota.com/Guthrie_Moves_to_New_Theater_on_the_River.html"&gt;The new Guthrie Theater&lt;/a&gt; is right next door and is a dazzling building in its own right (&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alttext/203304812/"&gt;photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/guthrietheater/interesting/"&gt;more photos&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Through the viewfinder</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;I picked up &lt;a href="http://www.butkus.org/chinon/kodak_duraflex_ii/kodak_duraflex_ii.htm"&gt;a Kodak Duraflex II camera&lt;/a&gt; at an antique store this weekend. I'm going to use to it do some &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/throughtheviewfinder/interesting/"&gt;through the viewfinder&lt;/a&gt; shots with the D70. The idea is that you take a photo of the Duraflex viewfinder with the SLR camera, thereby picking up all the spots, scratches, and curves of the old lens. A lens hood is required to block unwanted light reflections. &lt;a href="http://www.russmorris.com/ttv/"&gt;Here's a tutorial describing the process&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, it was after I bought the Duraflex that I discovered the need for a different lens on the SLR to make it work properly. We'll see if the 50 mm lens at home works. Some results soon. Hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Tales of the telegraph</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;L.C. Hall wrote an article in 1902 for McClure's Magazine called &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph-office.com/pages/Telegraph_Talk-McClure-1902.html"&gt;"Telegraph Talk and Talkers, Human Character and Emotions an Old Telegrapher Reads on the Wire"&lt;/a&gt;. Hall's article reveals a surprisingly wide range of information transmitted across telegraph wires between operators that has nothing to do with the messages being sent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The piece begins with an account of a "fast sending tournament", which contest reveals not only the quick sender, but the masterful:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presently a fair-haired young man takes the chair, self confidence and reserve force in every gesture. Away he goes, and his transmission is as swift and pure as a mountain stream. "To guard against mistakes and delays, the sender of a message should order it repeated back." The audience, enthralled, forgets the speed, and hearkens only to the beauty of the sending. On and on fly the dots and dashes, and though it is clear that his pace is not up to that set by the leaders, nevertheless there is a finish -- an indefinable quality of perfection in the performance that at the end brings the multitude to its feet in a spontaneous burst of applause; such an outburst as might have greeted a great piece of oratory or acting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many friendships were formed over the wire between senders who, judging mainly by the cadence of the code, sized up their counterparts from hundreds of miles away to the point of knowing their gender and general demeanor despite having never asked. Hall struck up such a friendship with a man called C G, whose attachment to Morse and Hall was so strong that he called out for him on his deathbed:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Late in the evening," said the [head nurse] as our interview was ending, "I was called into his room. He was rapidly failing, and was talking as if in a dream, two fingers of his right hand tapping the bedclothes as if he were sending a message. I did not understand the purport, but perhaps you will. 'You say you can't read me?' he would say; 'then let H come to the key. He can read and understand me. Let H come there, please.' Now and again his fingers would cease moving, as if he were waiting for the right person to answer. Then he would go on once more: 'Dear me, dear me, this will never do! I want to talk with H. I have an important message for him. Please tell him to hurry.' Then would follow another pause, during which he would murmur to himself regretfully. But at last he suddenly assumed the manner of one listening intently; then, his face breaking into a smile, he cried, his fingers keeping time with his words: 'Is that you, H? I'm so glad you've come! I have a message for you.' And so, his fingers tapping out an unspoken message, his kindly spirit took its flight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The article closes with a bit on telegraph slang, or "hog-Morse", when inexperienced operators slip up and send a bit of jibberish that expert receivers can nonetheless decipher from the context.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the patois of the wires "pot" means "hot," "foot" is rendered "fool," "U. S. Navy" is "us nasty," "home" is changed to "hog," and so on. If, for example, while receiving a telegram, a user of the patois should miss a word and say to you "6naz fimme q," the expert would know that he meant "Please fill me in." But there is no difficulty about the interpretation of the patois provided the receiver be experienced and always on the alert. When, however, the mind wanders in receiving, there is always danger that the hand will record exactly what the ear dictates. On one occasion, at Christmas time, a hilarious citizen of Rome, New York, telegraphed a friend at a distance a message which reached its destination reading, "Cog hog to rog and wemm pave a bumy tig." It looked to the man addressed like Choctaw, and of course was not understood. Upon being repeated, it read, "Come home to Rome, and we'll have a bully time." Another case of confusion wrought by hog-Morse was that of the Richmond, Virginia, commission firm, who were requested by wire to quote the price on a carload of "undressed slaves." The member of the firm who receipted for the telegram being something of a wag, wired back: "No trade in naked chattel since Emancipation Proclamation." The original message had been transmitted by senders of hog-Morse, called technically "hams," and the receivers had absent-mindedly recorded the words as they had really sounded. What the inquirer wanted, of course, was a quotation on a carload of staves in the rough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hog-Morse reminds me of the SMS typos which occur when T9 slips up or someone fat-fingers the wrong button on the phone. I can't recall how many times I've texted my wife "good soon", by which I meant that I'll be "home" shortly. It's also reminiscent of gamer &lt;a href="http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/citations/typo_slang_1/"&gt;typo slang&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn"&gt;pwned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teh"&gt;teh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=su%5B"&gt;su[&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more on the telegraph, particularly as it relates to contemporary communication technology, I highly recommend &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425171698/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;The Victorian Internet&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.tomstandage.com"&gt;Tom Standage&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Inline audio</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Last week, Vanity Fair published &lt;a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/features/general/060801fege01"&gt;an article about the U.S. Air Force's response to 9/11&lt;/a&gt;. In writing the article, Michael Bronner makes extensive use of audio tapes from the control room of NORAD's Northeast headquarters and in the online version, you can listen to audio clips of those tapes. As you can see in the screenshot below, not only are the transcripts of the audio part of the main narrative (and not collected elsewhere or put into a separate footnote or sidebar), but the controls for playing the audio clips (&lt;span style="color:#ff0000;"&gt;PLAY&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span style="color:#ff0000;"&gt;STOP&lt;/span&gt;) are presented inline as well:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/vanity-play.gif" width="420" height="327" alt="Inline audio on Vanity Fair" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's a nice bit of design. No need for a clunky player or to download the clips at the end of the article when two simple text-only inline commands will do. In &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961392177/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;Beautiful Evidence&lt;/a&gt;, Edward Tufte argues for the placement of information in the location where it will do the most good for those attempting to understand the matter at hand, regardless of form:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence is evidence, whether words numbers, images, diagrams, still or moving. It is all information after all. For readers and viewers, the intellectual task remains constant regardless of the particular mode of evidence: to understand and to reason about the materials at hand, and to appraise their quality, relevance, and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The examples that Tufte cites in the book are all visual and published on paper. This is an instance where web publishing provides for a better way to design for the information at hand than print. (thx to &lt;a href="http://lightningfield.com/"&gt;david&lt;/a&gt; for kickstarting this post)&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>How I Blog</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Seth Godin, who ruminates for a living, &lt;a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/09/what_makes_an_i.html"&gt;wrote a little something about how ideas are transmitted last year&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an idea to spread, it needs to be sent and received.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one "sends" an idea unless:&lt;br /&gt; a. they understand it&lt;br /&gt; b. they want it to spread&lt;br /&gt; c. they believe that spreading it will enhance their power (reputation, income, friendships) or their peace of mind&lt;br /&gt; d. the effort necessary to send the idea is less than the benefits&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one "gets" an idea unless:&lt;br /&gt; a. the first impression demands further investigation&lt;br /&gt; b. they already understand the foundation ideas necessary to get the new idea&lt;br /&gt; c. they trust or respect the sender enough to invest the time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seth hits the nail right on the head with this. When I'm deciding what links to post here, I'm essentially curating ideas, collecting them to "send" to you (and to myself, in a way). And unconsciously, these seven points factor into my decision on what to post here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a. they understand it&lt;/strong&gt; - I read everything I post and attempt to understand an article enough to represent it accurately when linking to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b. they want it to spread&lt;/strong&gt; - I pick links and write posts based on ideas that I think are in some way important, meaningful, relevent, or good for the soul. And sure, I want those ideas to be more widely known or enjoyed, even if it's something as simple as someone getting a needed chuckle from &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4aPGtx7e6k"&gt;a video of a monkey teasing a dog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c. they believe that spreading it will enhance their power (reputation, income, friendships) or their peace of mind&lt;/strong&gt; - This factors into anyone's motivations for anything. In George Orwell's 1947 essay &lt;a href="http://www.k-1.com/Orwell/index.cgi/work/essays/write.html"&gt;Why I Write&lt;/a&gt;, his #1 reason is "sheer egoism".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;d. the effort necessary to send the idea is less than the benefits&lt;/strong&gt; - If I wanted to, I could post 30 links or more a day without too much more effort on my part, but in this case, part of sending the idea is making sure the reader has enough attention to consider it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a. the first impression demands further investigation&lt;/strong&gt; - I spend a lot of time on getting the description of some linked text, photo, or video just right, so that the reader has a good idea of what they're getting into. Choosing a 1-2 sentence pull-quote that accurately represents the idea of an article is key in getting people's attention in a productive way. "This is an awesome link" is only going to cut it so many times; you need to tell people what the link is and give people an honest reason to click.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b. they already understand the foundation ideas necessary to get the new idea&lt;/strong&gt; - I assume visitors to the site are regular readers and that they have a good sense of what happens here, but I try to limit my reliance on jargon or "in-crowd" references so that everyone can follow along.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c. they trust or respect the sender enough to invest the time&lt;/strong&gt; - If I do all that other stuff right, hopefully you'll trust me enough to be receptive to the ideas I'm sending you. And if not, you probably won't trust me for long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like I said, all this was pretty much happening unconsciously. I've worked consciously on bits and pieces of it, but until I read Seth's post, I didn't know that this was the end-to-end process.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Web 2.0, a definition of sorts</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;37signals recently polled the customers of their online project management application and &lt;a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/what_web_20_means_to_500_random_basecamp_customers.php"&gt;one of the questions asked what Web 2.0 meant to them&lt;/a&gt;. They've posted &lt;a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/web2-500.html"&gt;500 answers to that question&lt;/a&gt; on their site; it's an interesting read. I decided to do a quick and dirty analysis of the most frequently used words by the respondents, hoping that the result would provide a collective definition of sorts for the term Web 2.0. By the time I'd finished (with several timeouts and distractive blog-related detours), I went back to the thread and saw that &lt;a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/what_web_20_means_to_500_random_basecamp_customers.php#c35607"&gt;Jacob Kaplan-Moss had already completed an analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Here are his top 15 words:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;web - 348&lt;br /&gt;ajax - 107&lt;br /&gt;applications - 93&lt;br /&gt;new - 78&lt;br /&gt;user - 71&lt;br /&gt;apps - 44&lt;br /&gt;desktop - 40&lt;br /&gt;sites - 37&lt;br /&gt;people - 36&lt;br /&gt;internet - 36&lt;br /&gt;content - 34&lt;br /&gt;think - 33&lt;br /&gt;software - 31&lt;br /&gt;services - 30&lt;br /&gt;technologies - 29&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just for kicks, here's my top 30:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;web: 347&lt;br /&gt; ajax: 105&lt;br /&gt; more: 99&lt;br /&gt; applications: 92&lt;br /&gt; new: 77&lt;br /&gt; user: 69&lt;br /&gt; use: 47&lt;br /&gt; apps: 43&lt;br /&gt; desktop: 39&lt;br /&gt; sites: 38&lt;br /&gt; internet: 35&lt;br /&gt; people: 35&lt;br /&gt; content: 33&lt;br /&gt; think: 32&lt;br /&gt; software: 30&lt;br /&gt; using: 30&lt;br /&gt; etc: 29&lt;br /&gt; services: 29&lt;br /&gt; next: 28&lt;br /&gt; technologies: 28&lt;br /&gt; interactive: 28&lt;br /&gt; generation: 27&lt;br /&gt; application: 25&lt;br /&gt; marketing: 25&lt;br /&gt; websites: 23&lt;br /&gt; better: 23&lt;br /&gt; social: 23&lt;br /&gt; users: 22&lt;br /&gt; hype: 22&lt;br /&gt; buzzword: 21&lt;br /&gt; interfaces: 20&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some reason (my shoddy programming skills are a likely culprit), my word counts are slightly different than Jacob's, but they're close. I also left in a few words that he removed but that I thought were relevant, like "more", "use", "using", and "etc". Here are a few more interesting words and their frequency counts:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;community: 17&lt;br /&gt; collaboration: 13&lt;br /&gt; companies: 13&lt;br /&gt; bubble: 10&lt;br /&gt; ruby: 9&lt;br /&gt; rounded: 9&lt;br /&gt; gradients: 8&lt;br /&gt; rails: 7&lt;br /&gt; 37signals: 6&lt;br /&gt; tagging: 6&lt;br /&gt; flickr: 5&lt;br /&gt; wikis: 5&lt;br /&gt; overused: 5&lt;br /&gt; o'reilly: 5&lt;br /&gt; hyped: 5&lt;br /&gt; overhyped: 5&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not sure this provides much of a definition, but it's fun to play around with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big ol' obvious caveat:&lt;/b&gt; I performed a straight-up word frequency analysis which did not take into account the context of particular words (e.g. no distinction between different uses of words like "think": "I think Web 2.0 sucks" and "Web 2.0 products make users think"), phrase frequency ("web 2.0", "next generation", "rounded corners"), or anything like that. This obviously limits the utility of the analysis; hence "quick and dirty".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; Perhaps a better "definition" of Web 2.0 comes from &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/web2.0"&gt;the related tags at del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ajax&lt;br /&gt; tools&lt;br /&gt; web&lt;br /&gt; blog&lt;br /&gt; webdesign&lt;br /&gt; software&lt;br /&gt; design&lt;br /&gt; social&lt;br /&gt; programming&lt;br /&gt; javascript&lt;br /&gt; business&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not bad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/11/there_has_been_.html"&gt;del.icio.us did this analysis back in November 2005&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Nordic geopolitics</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Heading into dinner last night, I believed with certainty that Finland was one of the Scandinavian countries. I rebuffed &lt;a href="http://www.blackbeltjones.com/work/"&gt;Mr. Jones'&lt;/a&gt; attempts to disabuse me of that notion before dessert arrived, but it wasn't until this morning that I checked into the matter and found that he may be correct.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Minneapolis Star Tribune &lt;a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:R80mGVFnAXsJ:www.startribune.com/161/story/182459.html+finland+scandinavia&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4"&gt;investigated the issue back in January&lt;/a&gt;, finding that there's some controversy, even among the staff at the Finnish Embassy in Washington D.C.:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I called the Finnish Embassy in Washington, D.C., where press aide Mari Poyhtari started by saying Finland is part of Scandinavia, but then someone in the background disagreed and she corrected herself. The most accurate term is Fenno-Scandinavia or the Nordic countries, Poyhtari said. But, she admitted, "We always say we're part of Scandinavia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia"&gt;The Wikipedia page on Scandinavia&lt;/a&gt;, the result of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Scandinavia"&gt;a vigorous discussion&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, indicates that there are several possible arrangements of Scandinavian countries, depending on the grouping criteria used and who you're talking to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Geographically, the Scandinavian peninsula includes mainland Norway, Sweden, and part of Finland.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the region, the common definition includes Norway, Denmark, and Sweden.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outside of the region, the term often includes not only Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland but also Iceland, a grouping commonly called the Nordic countries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linguistically speaking (pardon the pun), the Finnish language is unrelated to Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish, which is an argument for the cultural exclusion of Finland from Scandinavia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;So there you go, clear as mud. Probably best to avoid the issue altogether in the future by using the term Nordic instead of Scandinavian. &lt;a href="http://www.alllooksame.com/"&gt;All look same&lt;/a&gt; anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://underbelly-buce.blogspot.com/2006/08/who-is-scandinavian.html"&gt;Underbelly notes&lt;/a&gt; that this "issue is in no way limited to Scandinavians":&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;It's the kind of muddiness you just have to expect when you consider any culture. Was Cleopatra an Egyptian? Are the Tasmanians British? What did the Byzanatines have in mind when they described themselves as "The Romans" while fighting wars against, well, Rome?&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(thx, jack)&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Gopher still going</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_protocol"&gt;Gopher&lt;/a&gt;, developed in 1991 at the University of Minnesota, is a text-only, hierarchical document search and retrieval protocol that was supplanted by the more flexible WWW in the mid-1990s. Some servers running this old protocol are still alive, however. The WELL, an online discussion board and community that started back in 1985, is still running a Gopher server. If you've got a recent version of Firefox, you can check it out in its original Gopher-y state at &lt;a href="gopher://gopher.well.com/"&gt;gopher://gopher.well.com/&lt;/a&gt; or with any web browser at &lt;a href="http://gopher.well.com:70/"&gt;http://gopher.well.com:70/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems to have been frozen in early 1996 or so and houses several historical documents from the early 1990s. Many of the links are dead and some documents cannot be found, but poking around for 20 minutes or so, I found:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.com:70/0/matrix/internet/hobbes.internet.timeline"&gt;1994 edition of Hobbes' Internet Timeline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/"&gt;The current version is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/1/Publications/MONDO"&gt;Interviews from MONDO 2000&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/0/Publications/MONDO/william.txt"&gt;William Vollman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/0/Publications/MONDO/laurel.txt"&gt;Brenda Laurel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/0/Publications/MONDO/byr-lear.txt"&gt;a conversation between David Byrne and Timothy Leary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.com:70/1/Communications/2001"&gt;Scripts from a 1993 program on NBC called Almost 2001&lt;/a&gt;, "a 5-part series on Telecommunications and Technology".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.com:70/0/Communications/Highways_of_the_Mind.txt"&gt;Highways of the Mind&lt;/a&gt;, an essay by Roger Karraker from 1991 on the future of technology and globally networked humanity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.com:70/0/Community/gaskins.farm"&gt;A 1972 article by then-journalist Al Gore&lt;/a&gt; about the leader of a communal settlement in Tennessee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.com:70/0/Community/small.town"&gt;A profile and history of The WELL&lt;/a&gt; from September 1993.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/1/Publications/authors"&gt;Some miscellaneous writings&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/1/Publications/authors/Sterling"&gt;some stuff by Bruce Sterling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the articles by Sterling, &lt;a href="http://gopher.well.sf.ca.us:70/0/Publications/authors/Sterling/cfp4"&gt;his remarks from a privacy conference in 1994&lt;/a&gt;, touches on a topic that's still hotly debated today:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been asked to explain why I don't worry much about the topics of privacy threat raised by this panel. And I don't. One reason is that these scenarios seem to assume that there will be large, monolithic bureaucracies (of whatever character, political or economic) that are capable of harnessing computers for one-way surveillance of an unsuspecting populace. I've come to feel that computation just doesn't work that way. Being afraid of monolithic organizations especially when they have computers, is like being afraid of really big gorillas especially when they are on fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don't follow Sterling's writing that closely, but I wonder if he's changed his mind on this issue?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matisse Enzer helped set up The WELL's Gopher server and &lt;a href="http://twoalpha.blogspot.com/2006/04/well-gopher.html"&gt;tells how it came to be on his blog&lt;/a&gt;. And here are a few other Gopher servers that are still running:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="gopher://aerv.nl/1"&gt;gopher://aerv.nl/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="gopher://hal3000.cx/1"&gt;gopher://hal3000.cx/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="gopher://quux.org/1"&gt;gopher://quux.org/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="gopher://sdf.lonestar.org/11/users"&gt;gopher://sdf.lonestar.org/11/users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href="http://gopherproject.org/Software/Gopher"&gt;http://gopherproject.org/Software/Gopher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; It occurs to me that this might be up the alley of Digg's users. If you've got an account there, you may wish to &lt;a href="http://digg.com/hardware/Gopher_servers_still_online"&gt;Digg this story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/util/gopher/gophercon1.txt"&gt;Here's a write-up of GopherCon '92&lt;/a&gt;, "a small working session of Gopher developers and users". I liked this bit:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ed Vielmetti of CICnet gave a talk on "what we would be gathering to discuss if UMinn had never developed Gopher", meaning primarily World-Wide Web (WWW). WWW was developed for the high-energy physics community and serves as a model of what Gopher could do if a discipline-oriented virtual community invested in it heavily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks for sending that along, &lt;a href="http://vielmetti.typepad.com/"&gt;Ed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/"&gt;The archives of the infamous spies.com Gopher server appear to be here&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know how complete they are or when they're from. (via &lt;a href="http://digg.com/hardware/Gopher_servers_still_online#c2531848"&gt;digg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; (with comments)</summary>

      <title>Baseball card days</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Dave Jamieson used to collect baseball cards and &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2146218"&gt;recently uncovered his stash&lt;/a&gt; when he cleaned out the closet of his childhood home. In attempting to recoup some of the time and money spent in his youth on this cardboard, Jamieson found that baseball cards aren't as popular or as lucrative as they used to be:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baseball cards peaked in popularity in the early 1990s. They've taken a long slide into irrelevance ever since, last year logging less than a quarter of the sales they did in 1991. Baseball card shops, once roughly 10,000 strong in the United States, have dwindled to about 1,700. A lot of dealers who didn't get out of the game took a beating. "They all put product in their basement and thought it was gonna turn into gold," Alan Rosen, the dealer with the self-bestowed moniker "Mr. Mint," told me. Rosen says one dealer he knows recently struggled to unload a cache of 7,000 Mike Mussina rookie cards. He asked for 25 cents apiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Close readers of kottke.org know that I collected sports cards too. I got involved in this prepubescent hobby later than most; I was 14 or 15 when a friend and his older brother -- who was around 24 and collecting for investment -- introduced me to it. &lt;a href="http://www.kottke.org/01/04/i-have-an-embarrassing-admission"&gt;And I loved it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still have them all somewhere, in boxes, collecting dust faster than value. The Ken Griffey Jr. Upper Deck rookie, the 130 different Nolan Ryan cards, the complete 1989 Hoops set (with the David Robinson rookie), and several others I really can't remember right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to spend untold hours sifting through them, looking up the values in Beckett's Price Guide, visiting card shops, flipping through commons to complete sets, looking for patterns in Topps' rack packs (I scored many a Jim Abbott rookie with this technique), chewing that ancient bubble gum (I bought a pack of 1983 cards once and chewed the gum...it was horrible), and keeping track of the total value of my collection with a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet on my dad's 286. It was a lot of fun at the time (as the Web is fun for me now); I guess that's about all one can ask for from a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recently I stumbled across &lt;a href="http://baseballcardblog.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Baseball Card Blog&lt;/a&gt; and was hit by a giant wave of nostalgia for my old obsession. One thing led to another -- you know how that goes -- and before I knew it, a package was speeding its way to me from a card shop in Pennsylvania containing several 1989 Fleer &amp;amp; Donruss wax packs, a 1989 Topps rack pack, and a couple of 1987 Topps wax packs.&lt;sup id="t0725061"&gt;&lt;a href="#f0725061"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've been opening a pack every few days since they arrived. Smell is the sense most powerfully associated with memory, so getting a whiff of that cardboard is really sending me back. Like a wine connoisseur, I can even smell the difference between each brand of card; the smell of Topps cards holds the strongest memories for me...the 1989 Topps set was my favorite. I opened the '87 Topps packs with &lt;a href="http://hello.typepad.com"&gt;a fellow ex-collector&lt;/a&gt;, but when we tried to chew the gum, it tasted like the cards and turned to a muddy dust in our mouths. But that was mostly what happened even when the gum was new, so we were unsurprised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of the aforementioned slump in the baseball card collecting economy, the card packs I ordered were the same price I paid for them as a kid (factoring for inflation), even though they're almost 20 years old and way more scarce. Back then, I used most of my $5/week allowance on cards, and it took weeks and months of patience to buy enough packs to complete a set, procure that Griffey rookie card, or amass enough Mark McGwires to trade to a friend for a desired Nolan Ryan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an adult, I have the cashflow to buy any card I want whenever I want (within reason). Or several boxes of cards, so as to compile complete sets instantly. Or I can just purchase the complete sets and skip the intermediate step. I could buy an entire box of 1989 Upper Deck packs -- at $1.25 per pack and nearly impossible to find in rural Wisconsin, an unimaginable extravagance for me as a kid -- &lt;a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/1989-Upper-Deck-Low-Baseball-Wax-Box-Ken-Griffey-Jr-R_W0QQitemZ290011848348QQihZ019QQcategoryZ70380QQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem"&gt;right now on eBay&lt;/a&gt;. When I think about the financial advantages I now have over my 16-yo self in collecting the same exact cards, I feel like the NY Yankees (and their &lt;a href="http://benfry.com/salaryper/"&gt;monster payroll&lt;/a&gt;) competing in a Single A league. It's unfair and even thinking about collecting cards in that manner takes a lot of the fun out of it for me. If I do start collecting cards again, I'm going to approach it like I did back then: by hand, a little at a time, and treating even the essentially worthless commons with care. Unless Nolan Ryan is involved...in that case, &lt;a href="http://www.homeruncards.com/rookiecards/nolan-ryan-rookie-card.shtml"&gt;the sky's the limit&lt;/a&gt;, although I might have to sell my bicycle to get it. In the meantime, I'm waiting for the next household footwear purchase so I can put my newly purchased cards in the shoe box for safe keeping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a id="f0725061"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[1] A quick note on terminology. A "wax pack" is a basic pack of around 15 cards (plus gum, when cards still had gum packaged with them), so-called because the packages used to be sealed with wax. (Now they're all probably packaged in plastic and whatnot...I don't know, I haven't kept up.) The bottom card in such a pack is called a "wax back" because the card got a thin layer of wax on it from the sealing process. A "rack pack" is a hanging triple pack made of see-thru plastic. A "common" is an ordinary card not worth very much, as opposed to cards or rookies, hot prospects, all-stars, and the like. A "box" contains several wax packs, typically 20-40 packs/box. A "complete set" is a collection of every card sold by a company in a particular year. The '89 Topps set had 792 cards. Sets were sold in factory-sealed boxes or were compiled by hand from cards acquired in packs. &lt;a href="#t0725061"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Beautiful Evidence by Edward R. Tufte</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Beautiful Evidence is both the title of &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961392177/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;Edward Tufte's latest book&lt;/a&gt; and an accurate description of the document itself. Like few other mass market publications, BE is lovingly hand-crafted, a physical manifestation of the ideas expressed in its pages; the text and images therein could be about another subject entirely and you might still get the point: "Words, Numbers, Images - Together" (the title of the book's fourth chapter).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Case in point. Pages 123 and 124 fold out into a spread depicting &lt;a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/minard"&gt;Charles Joseph Minard's famous infographic&lt;/a&gt; of the disastrous 1812 invasion of Russia by France. But unlike most magazine and book fold-outs, the page that folds out is cut 1/2 inch narrower than the underlying page so that a) a bit of the page underneath peeks out, providing a visual cue for unfoldability, and b) there's no difficulty when you go to refold the page with getting it caught in the book's crease or otherwise undesirably bending/creasing it. The fold-out design is a small thing that the casual reader might not even notice, but it demonstrates the care that went into the production of the book (and perhaps the reason why Tufte took so long in writing/designing it).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gang at 37signals &lt;a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/fly_on_the_wall_the_magic_is_that_everything_has_a_center_of_gravity_you_just_need_to_find_it.php"&gt;noticed similar craftsmanship in the writing and presentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What struck me is how you almost never have to hold something in your head while turning the page...he usually finishes his thought within the two pages you can see...and when you flip, it's something new...that's an excellent self-imposed constraint...'whatever i need to say, i'll do it here.'" Jason replied, "Yes, I love that. I noticed that more on this book than others. The image and text is in one spread so when you turn you are turning your attention to a new idea. If you have too much to say than the space allowed then you are probably saying too much...it definitely makes it easier to design the book too...you can design each spread as if it was a standalone poster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I've also noticed about Beautiful Evidence is the lack of reviews in mainstream publications; I can't find a single newspaper or magazine that has published a review. Compare that to the releases of Gladwell's Blink, Remnick's Reporting, and Anderson's The Long Tail, for which reviews started appearing almost everywhere before the books were even available. Those books were written for mass audiences and backed by large publishing companies with ample PR resources and plenty of review copies to go around. In contrast, Beautiful Evidence is self-published by Tufte, which means it's beautiful, personal, and done just right, but also invisible to the mainstream press. Not that Beautiful Evidence is being ignored -- &lt;a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=%22beautiful+evidence%22"&gt;the blogosphere is talking about it&lt;/a&gt; and the Amazon Sales Rank is currently about 600 (which doesn't count online sales &lt;a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be"&gt;directly from edwardtufte.com&lt;/a&gt;) -- but it deserves the consideration of the mainstream press.&lt;/p&gt; (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0961392177/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;View @ Amazon&lt;/a&gt;)</summary>

      <title>Ding-a-ling circus</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;One of the first reviews Ruth Reichl wrote as the New York Times food critic was of Le Cirque, a fancy French restaurant in midtown Manhattan. In &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DA1039F93AA15753C1A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;the now-famous piece&lt;/a&gt;, immortalied in her memoir, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594200319/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;Garlic and Sapphires&lt;/a&gt;, Reichl compares the service she receives at the restaurant as a welcomed reviewer with that as an average Jane. From &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DA1039F93AA15753C1A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;the review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of five months I ate five meals at the restaurant; it was not until the fourth that the owner, Sirio Maccioni, figured out who I was. When I was discovered, the change was startling. Everything improved: the seating, the service, the size of the portions. We had already reached dessert, but our little plate of petit fours was whisked away to be replaced by a larger, more ostentatious one. An avalanche of sweets descended upon the table, and I was fascinated to note that the raspberries on the new desserts were three times the size of those on the old ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thirteen years later, current food critic Frank Bruni &lt;a href="http://events.nytimes.com/2006/07/19/dining/reviews/19rest.html?ei=5090&amp;en=0f42fca6575221f7&amp;ex=1310961600&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;reviews the newest incarnation of Le Cirque in today's Times&lt;/a&gt; and echoing Reichl's technique, finds that little has changed:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also experienced Le Cirque's famously split personality, half dismissive and half pampering, depending on who you are. On my first visit, when a companion and I arrived before the two other members of our party, a host let us know we should wait in the bar area not by asking or telling us to go there but by gesturing silently in that direction with his head. Most of the seats were occupied, so we stood. Over the next 10 minutes, no one asked us if we wanted a drink or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After we were taken to our table, servers seemed to figure out who I was and offered to move us to prime real estate with better sightlines. (We declined.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So on a subsequent visit I sent three friends in ahead of me. One sat at the bar for 15 minutes without getting a server's attention, and a bartender quarreled with the two others when they asked that the charges for their Champagne be transferred to the table. At a place as self-consciously posh as Le Cirque, such a request should be granted instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was treated like royalty when I showed up, and on another night, when I dined with a filmmaker whom the staff also knew, soft-shell crabs, which weren't on the menu, appeared almost as soon as she mentioned an appetite for them. They were fantastic: crunchy, meaty, sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can't imagine wanting to go someplace like that when there's so many other places with food as good or better and where the service is friendly, helpful, and accommodating for everybody. I guess that's the side of New York I don't like.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Shake Shack vs. In-N-Out smackdown</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Here it is, the awful truth. After sampling &lt;a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/"&gt;In-N-Out Burger&lt;/a&gt; twice this past weekend (a cheeseburger with raw onion and, 4 days later, a Double Double w/ no onions) and having had several &lt;a href="http://shakeshacknyc.com"&gt;Shack Burgers&lt;/a&gt; this year (my most recent one was a couple of weeks ago), an adequate comparison between the two can be made. The verdict?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Shake Shack burger wins in a landslide. It's more flavorful, features a better balance of ingredients, and a yummier bun. On the french fries front, In-N-Out's fresh-cut fries get the nod.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Courtesy of &lt;a href="http://mena.vox.com/"&gt;Mena&lt;/a&gt;, something to keep in mind: a cheeseburger at In-N-Out is $1.85 while a similarly appointed Shack Burger is $4.38, almost 2.5 times as much. SS french fries are nearly twice the price of In-N-Out fries. The burger comparison is an unfair one because, despite its location and style, Shake Shack is a restaurant and In-N-Out is a fast food joint. That the burgers are even close enough to compare -- and make no mistake, I still love the In-N-Out burger -- says a great deal about In-N-Out.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Play Money: Or, How I Quit My Day Job and Made Millions Trading Virtual Loot by Julian Dibbell</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;During the depths of the dot com bust, &lt;a href="http://www.juliandibbell.com/"&gt;Julian Dibbell&lt;/a&gt; looked online for a job and found one as a commodities trader in the Ultima Online virtual world. During one particularly productive month, he made almost US$4000. Dibbell has a book coming out about the experience, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465015352/ref=nosim/0sil8"&gt;Play Money: Or, How I Quit My Day Job and Made Millions Trading Virtual Loot&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to being available at bookstores in meatspace, Play Money will also be on sale in the virtual world of Second Life in the currency of that world (Linden dollars). From the press release:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-game versions of Play Money designed by Second Life coder/publisher Falk Bergman are available for L$750. These copies can be signed by Dibbell at his in-Second Life interview with journalist Wagner James Au on July 27th. For the Second Life resident who needs something a bit more tactile, L$6250 buys a real-life copy of Play Money, shipped with care to the buyer's real life address, in addition to the standard in-game version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(At the time of this press release, Linden dollars are trading at approximately L$300.00 to the US$1.00. Adjusted to US dollars, an online copy costs US$2.50, and the price of a real-life copy bought in-game is around US$20.85.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dibbell will be &lt;a href="http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2006/07/julian_dibbell_.html"&gt;signing his virtual books&lt;/a&gt; in Second Life on July 27th. Caterina read Play Money and &lt;a href="http://www.caterina.net/archive/000993.html"&gt;has some thoughts on its relation to her work/play at Ludicorp&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Taste3 conference</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough to attend &lt;a href="http://www.taste3.com"&gt;the Taste3 conference&lt;/a&gt; in Napa Valley, CA over the weekend. What a nice change from technology conferences. Instead of software demo CDs in the schwag bags, there were bottles of wine and chocolate and instead of BOF gatherings on podcasting, there were dinners with fine wine and yummy cheese. As you would expect, the folks in the hospitality industry are a lot more outgoing than the nerds; except for me, there was a distinct lack of people standing in corners looking down at their shoes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the next few days I'll be posting some thoughts and links from the conference; I hope they'll be as interesting as the conference was.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <summary>Ever hear of the Cyrus Cylinder? Apparently, neither has AhmadiNejad...</summary>&lt;p&gt;Ever hear of the Cyrus Cylinder? Apparently, neither has &lt;a ref="nofollow" href="http://www.ahmadinejad.ir/" title="Procedure 'sptblHits_Insert' expects parameter '@hitUserAgent', which was not supplied."&gt;AhmadiNejad&lt;/a&gt;. From the &lt;a href="http://www.iranchamber.com/history/cyrus/cyrus_charter.php" title="http://www.iranchamber.com/history/cyrus/cyrus_charter.php"&gt;Iran Chamber Society&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charter of Cyrus the Great, a baked-clay Aryan language (Old Persian) cuneiform cylinder, was discovered in 1878 in excavation of the site of Babylon. In it, Cyrus the Great described his human treatment of the inhabitants of Babylonia after its conquest by the Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And from Wikipedia&amp;#8217;s page on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Cylinder" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Cylinder"&gt;Cyrus the Great&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the cylinder reflects a long tradition in Mesopotamia where, as early as the third millennium BC, kings such as Urukagina began their reigns with declarations of reforms, the cylinder of Cyrus is often referred to in modern times as the &amp;#8220;first charter of human rights.&amp;#8221; In 1971, the United Nations translated and published it into all of its official languages. The cylinder decrees the normal themes of Persian rule: &lt;strong&gt;religious tolerance&lt;/strong&gt;, abolishment of slavery, freedom of choice of profession and expansion of the empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironic? I kid you not.

There&amp;#8217;s no magic bullet - it takes dedication, skill, time, and luck. Oh, and it also helps if you read the free &lt;a HREF="http://www.associateprograms.com/pages/77ways.html"&gt;77 ways&lt;/a&gt; eBook by my friend, Allan Gardyne. I flipped through it late last night, and it seems to be pretty spot on. Unfortunately, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of SEO stuff in there - which can be really dry and confusing for &amp;#8220;real people&amp;#8221; who just want to write and have their voices heard by the masses.

      <summary>As revealed in last night&amp;#8217;s report, I&amp;#8217;m going on an Alaskan cruise in another week or so...</summary>&lt;p&gt;As revealed in last night&amp;#8217;s report, I&amp;#8217;m going on an &lt;a href="http://channels.lockergnome.com/windows/archives/20060815_a_gnome_alaska_cruise.phtml" title="http://channels.lockergnome.com/windows/archives/20060815_a_gnome_alaska_cruise.phtml"&gt;Alaskan cruise&lt;/a&gt; in another week or so. Friends tell me that there are breathtaking photographs waiting to be taken of the Alaskan landscape - but can I rent (borrow?) higher-quality hardware for a week? The cruise is already going to be expensive to begin with. Here&amp;#8217;s a fraction of the feedback I received this morning&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connie Devine&lt;/strong&gt;: Cruises aren&amp;#8217;t what they used to be. Forget that shuffleboard stuff. You are going to love it. Holland/America is a fantastic cruise line (yes, I am Dutch). Also I have a friend that works as Tour Director for Princess Cruises and almost every ship she goes on has internet access and sometimes it is part of the package, so check that out. Either way, relax and let them pamper you and drink in the views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Raven&lt;/strong&gt;: I loved the Alaska Cruise last summer and wanted to go this summer too. The seas are fairly calm since the land is usually on both sides of the boat. They do have Internet access (yes it is expensive) on the ship and you may be able to get some access from the boat at some ports. Bring your laptop to dump your digital photos. My wife, son and I took almost 11,000 pictures last summer during that week. The scenery is awesome. Wild life is beyond awesome (Whales, Porpoises, Eagles, Salmon, Bears, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom D. Kerrigan&lt;/strong&gt;: The main thing I have heard from people taking these cruises is to be careful of the food! There is food everywhere all day and all night long. This could wreck havoc with your diet. Are you at the downtown terminal or the one by the West &lt;a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/2004/12/28/seeing-seattle/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="Seattle"&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt; Bridge? I work across the street (Kind of) from the terminal by the West Seattle Bridge. On my daily walk I go by the 2 Alaska cruise ships every Friday and after working the weekend found out they also have Saturday sailings. I am at the Seattle Lighting Warehouse/Offices there across Aurora from the terminal. Have a great cruise. I am very undecided if I would ever want to take a cruise, the travel plans seem too structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncle Bob&lt;/strong&gt;: If you get a chance go fishing, I&amp;#8217;ve been only once but would go again even with all the airline security. Take all the side trips you can, I was amazed it wasn&amp;#8217;t all ice and snow. Don&amp;#8217;t let anyone try and print your pictures for you, I lost 8 rolls of film and see one of my shots quite often in publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dennis Williams&lt;/strong&gt;: Holland America is a wonderful cruise line, but be prepared to be the youngest people on board. The &amp;#8220;average&amp;#8221; age is about 72. We&amp;#8217;ve taken several with HAL and loved them, but the folks are old for the most part (we are, too, at 64 and 62). Bon Voyage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charlie Burkey Jr.&lt;/strong&gt;: Cheer up! Sounds like a cruise to AK will do you some good. As an AK reader of &lt;a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="Technology News"  rel="external"&gt;Lockergnome&lt;/a&gt; (not sure I&amp;#8217;m ready to claim the title of Lockergnomie - or whatever), let me say what I say to everyone who is thinking about visiting AK: you owe it to yourself to see AK and you won&amp;#8217;t be sorry you did. We don&amp;#8217;t live in igloos and I&amp;#8217;ve been told that a higher percentage of Alaskans have computers in their homes (practically all connected to the Internet) than any other state. We do have Internet in AK. Come on up and enjoy the Inside Passage, you&amp;#8217;ll be glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bern Muller&lt;/strong&gt;: Chris, we have cruised around the world with Holland America. They are great. All Holland America ships have satellite internet connections. I take my laptop, and go to one of the hotspots on board, and hook up. But it is expensive. I hope you enjoy Alaska. We did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kent&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;#8217;m sure that you will find HAL (Holland American) to be a great line. Treat the waiters as friends not slaves and you will have made a # of good friends. If you like bread pudding, go to the lunch buffet on the Lido deck. Great. Good ice cream and cookies there also. You will find a lot to do. If it would make you feel better, you stay home and I&amp;#8217;ll go in your place. BW and I have been on 11 HAL cruises and are planning another for Nov 06. Relax and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eddie&lt;/strong&gt;: I really do feel for you being away from your computer for a whole week. You cannot even take your Dell with you as it might catch fire. Azipod propulsion was designed by the same people that developed Windows XP, so you have nothing to worry about. Just go and have a good time, and take your camera with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leland&lt;/strong&gt;: My focus isn&amp;#8217;t Alaska but you can pick up some good &lt;a href="http://www.cruiseknowledge.com/" title="http://www.cruiseknowledge.com/"&gt;cruise tips&lt;/a&gt; that are practical from my website. By the way, without the encouragement from Chris&amp;#8217;s newsletters over the years, it wouldn&amp;#8217;t exist. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Accornero&lt;/strong&gt;: Look at Wikipedia for the definition of Azipod. There are pictures of the propulsion system, showing that the Coast Guard is using the system, and what it looks like and how it saves fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill K&lt;/strong&gt;: Your cruise ship has an internet cafe on board and all staterooms have an internet connection. So don&amp;#8217;t forget to pack your laptop. Just don&amp;#8217;t tell you know who!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Holland America&amp;#8217;s site, &amp;#8220;Guests can send and receive electronic mail in real-time, via a high speed satellite link 24 hours a day, satellite conditions permitting.&amp;#8221; It also says I can use my own laptop. So, I should have Internet access on the cruise (albeit on a limited basis). There&amp;#8217;s no access pricing on HollandAmerica.com, but I imagine I&amp;#8217;m going to have to find a sponsor to help cover the costs. That way, I can do a check-in every day from the high seas. Or a few recorded Skypecasts, perhaps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My special email address will be pirillo7071 @ oosterdam.cruisemail.net - but I&amp;#8217;m not sure how that will work yet.

      <summary>Ponzi purchased the world&amp;#8217;s most expensive noise cancelling headphones from Bose the other day&amp;#8230; which cost as much as her second iPod (actually, third - if you want to count the Shuffle)...</summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ponzarelli.com/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="Latthanapon Indharasophang"  rel="external"&gt;Ponzi&lt;/a&gt; purchased the world&amp;#8217;s most expensive noise cancelling headphones from Bose the other day&amp;#8230; which cost as much as her second iPod (actually, third - if you want to count the Shuffle). I gotta admit, they&amp;#8217;re quite comfortable on the ears. I&amp;#8217;ll have to give &amp;#8216;em a good spin to decide if I&amp;#8217;m going to pick up a pair, too:&lt;/p&gt;

Just slip them on and experience the difference our proprietary technologies make. Enjoy full-spectrum noise reduction that fades background distractions. Rich, clear audio that reveals nuances you might have missed. And a compact, lightweight, easy fit for hours of comfortable listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate earphones - I don&amp;#8217;t care how much &amp;#8220;better&amp;#8221; they are. When I was a kid, my mom told me never to stick anything in my ears - especially if it does nothing but collect wax and make my ear canal sore.

Seriously. &lt;a HREF="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1110AP_Puppies_Killed.html"&gt;60 puppies die in Mass. trailer fire&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The puppies were all beautiful, healthy purebreds that were on their way to quality retailers in the northeast and eventually to loving New England families,&amp;#8221; the company said in a statement. The company said it has a near-perfect safety record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers?! So help me God, if these beautiful creatures were being shipped to mall-based pet stores, I&amp;#8217;m going to scream. Dogs die every day on the streets, in homes, at the pound, etc. - but 60 of them, &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;? That&amp;#8217;s just so incredibly sad. The senseless loss of human life is to be equally lamented, but&amp;#8230; puppies?! How could your heart not drop after hearing of this accident?

Seriously, help. WordPress doesn&amp;#8217;t handle templates as nicely as MovableType does - which is a major problem for those of us who use either platform as a site-wide CMS. I need a &amp;#8220;purifier&amp;#8221; plugin developed to help me get around a gigantic problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generate email newsletters from static pages (URLs), generated by templates and includes through MovableType. I need a simple way to call a WordPress template that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has been stripped of all rich data: JavaScript, iFrames, Flash, etc..
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pulls in all CSS to be rendered inline rather than via link.
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can have a unique header and/or footer element.
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is not indexed by the search engines.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d imagine this would be another template (or subset), though I don&amp;#8217;t know how it would necessarily be called upon. For my purposes, I&amp;#8217;d need to pull in data relative to dates (as in, render a purified page for content published on 2006/07/31). I&amp;#8217;d also imagine that I can&amp;#8217;t be the only one screaming for this feature. Any email newsletter brethren (or sistren) care to prove to me that email, indeed, is not quite dead yet?

      <summary>Pluto is officially a planet - an announcement which is already sparking controversy in the astronosphere (that&amp;#8217;s the sexy world of astronomers)...</summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/embargo/iau0601/iau0601_resolution.html" title="http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/embargo/iau0601/iau0601_resolution.html"&gt;Pluto is officially a planet&lt;/a&gt; - an announcement which is already sparking controversy in the astronosphere (that&amp;#8217;s the sexy world of astronomers). Seems that professional stargazers have battles just like bloggers do. &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2006/08/15/congratulations-its-a-planet/" title="Bad Astronomy Blog &amp;amp;raquo; Congratulations! It&amp;amp;#8217;s a planet!"&gt;The Bad Astronomer&lt;/a&gt;, as always, sums it up nicely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem here is simple, really: we&amp;#8217;re trying to wrap a scientific definition around a culturally-defined word that has no strict definition. Doing this will only lead to trouble. Why? For one thing, it’s divisive and silly. How does a definition help us at all? And how does it make things less confusing than they already are? Charon is a planet? It’s smaller than our own Moon!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gawd, this sounds exactly like the whole RSS vs. Atom vs. Feed debate all over again - with a lot more comet dust. I bet our kids will have to study and memorize the names of all the plutons in the solar system soon enough. Coincidentally, the face on Mars just sneezed (five minutes ago, according to Wikipedia).

Dr...</summary>&lt;p&gt;I became a &lt;a href="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/" title="http://www.coasttocoastam.com/"&gt;Coast to Coast&lt;/a&gt; Streamlink member this weekend - I just love following the lunatic fringe. Dr. Phil was on to talk about the &lt;a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2006/08/15/astrology-hath-no-fury/" title="Bad Astronomy Blog &amp;amp;raquo; Astrology hath no fury&amp;amp;#8230;"&gt;planet Pluto&lt;/a&gt; last night, and when he referenced &amp;#8220;Giant Ice Balls&amp;#8221; - I sent him an instant message, claiming that I had &amp;#8220;giant ice balls.&amp;#8221; To which he immediately responded, &amp;#8220;mine are brass.&amp;#8221; Talk about paranormal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I generally enjoy listening to C2C - especially when JC comes on (great comic relief). Tonight&amp;#8217;s guest is &lt;a href="http://www.kimballcollege.com/" title="The Offical Ancient Manuscripts"&gt;Glenn Kimball&lt;/a&gt; - and he&amp;#8217;s going to be discussing the history of terrorism. I&amp;#8217;m sure &lt;a href="http://www.skepticality.com/" title="http://www.skepticality.com/"&gt;skeptics&lt;/a&gt; will be debunking Glenn left-and-right, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t make his research any less interesting. History does not come from books, you know? Sometimes the only way to truly understand history is by challenging its &amp;#8220;truths.&amp;#8221; The Earth used to be flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;#8217;re on the subject of UFOs (even though I hadn&amp;#8217;t had a chance to work them into the conversation until now), I&amp;#8217;m convinced that the C2C Web crew are aliens. When I asked &amp;#8216;em for the direct podcast URL, they said: &amp;#8220;The recent release of iTunes is non-compatible with our Podcasting system.&amp;#8221; No, their &amp;#8220;system&amp;#8221; is incompatible with the rest of the galaxy - get it straight. No matter, I can always download the archives on-demand.

We&amp;#8217;re actually going to be porting Technobabble from MT to WP very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you MCSE certified? Thinking about getting certified or in the process? Want to share your MCSE certification stories? We’re considering a series of articles about the MCSE certification process, but it’s all based on reader input. We want to hear your war stories - real names withheld on request. Whether you’ve shouldered through a MCSE boot camp or struggled with training CDs or books, we need to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you got any MCSE tips floating around?

Because Gabe refuses to index mimed tech podcast feeds within &lt;a href="http://www.techmeme.com/" title="TechMeme"&gt;TechMeme&lt;/a&gt;! Mr. Rivera must be afraid of mimes or something? He&amp;#8217;s totally ignoring the mimetype community. Someone needs to develop a mimetracker and totally rule the market. I&amp;#8217;m gesticulating wildly over here to fill space.

      <summary>TechTV was a television network that held within it so much promise, so much talent. We had an army of fanatics stationed all around the globe...</summary>&lt;p&gt;      TechTV was a television network that held within it so much promise, so much talent. We had an army of fanatics stationed all around the globe. The Internet-savvy did everything in their power to empower that very community - but many of those efforts fell victim to a traditional media mindset. We&amp;#8217;re now on the cusp of a new media revolution, and I&amp;#8217;ve begun to spearhead efforts to ressurect the ideals of TechTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      When I seeded the idea about letting the community help us centralize, the response was overwhelming - both from TechTV alumni and our ever-present supporters. I&amp;#8217;m here to tell you now: it&amp;#8217;s going to happen. I don&amp;#8217;t know how it&amp;#8217;s going to happen, but&amp;#8230; that&amp;#8217;s what makes it worth doing! The most difficult hurdle has already been overcome, in my opinion: we have an audience that is NOT being served effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      ZDTV/TechTV brought us all together, but that brand belongs to somebody else - to a completely different time and management style. It&amp;#8217;s not the name that&amp;#8217;s most important - it&amp;#8217;s what we do with that name which will prove our validity and worth. The whole is always greater than the sum of its parts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      Leo and I have discussed a few core values this impending structure must support, the most revolutionary of which is content producers owning 100% of their contributions. We want to enable former TechTV talent to upload new and existing content, and we want to bring new talent into the fold as well. Sales will also be an important part of this process, so we&amp;#8217;d also like to help match sponsorship with these personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      The working (and likely final) name for this project is simple, poignant, and genre-neutral: UndoTV. I&amp;#8217;ve registered UndoTV.com, Undo.tv, UndoTV.net, and UndoTV.org through GoDaddy. I believe that UndoTV.com will be the primary domain (with Undo.tv being a permanent redirect to it). It&amp;#8217;s my hope to turn over UndoTV.net and UndoTV.org to the community, letting vetted leaders craft those sites with tools of their choosing. Perhaps one could hold within it a wiki, another could hold a customized version of MUWP &lt;span class="781423801-13082006"&gt;(which I&amp;#8217;m developing for &lt;a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="Technology News"  rel="external"&gt;Lockergnome&lt;/a&gt;.com anyway)&lt;/span&gt;? That&amp;#8217;s completely up to you, my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      Why UndoTV? Several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some former TechTV talent are no longer producing tech content.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#8217;re undoing TechTV&amp;#8217;s untimely and unwarranted demise.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The television industry is changing, and we&amp;#8217;re all helping &amp;#8220;undo&amp;#8221; it.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are few preconceived notions with the word &amp;#8220;undo.&amp;#8221;
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CTRL+Z reference is geeky enough, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t turn off non-geeks.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The appropriate domains were available.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Informal reactions to the &amp;#8220;UndoTV&amp;#8221; name were positive.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
       All TechTV/ZDTV fans will find us, no matter what we call it.
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      A good name is important, but not as important as what we make of that name. What did &amp;#8220;Digg&amp;#8221; mean before the community pushed it to a powerhouse? &lt;span class="781423801-13082006"&gt;What&amp;#8217;s more, we&amp;#8217;re really trying to help people who are afraid of technology - and getting a technophobe to pay attention to &amp;#8220;tech&amp;#8221; anything is nothing short of impossible. Let me put it to you another way: how do normal people discover YouTube videos?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      I&amp;#8217;m confident that the timing for UndoTV is perfect. Leo and I have identified a potential platform to begin publishing through, but an actual launch date is still in the air. We have every element in line for success: an amazing community, a range of great talent, and a strong desire to push the media industry forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      Could be the Peet&amp;#8217;s talking, but&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m excited. Next steps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft a unique logo
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prep the site structure
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locate smart sponsors
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact interested talent
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solicit community feedback
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify organizational needs
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define necessary roles
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flesh out legal structure
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Here we go. Let&amp;#8217;s see if Dvorak likes the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

      <summary>Guy would never hire me. And you know what? I&amp;#8217;m fine with that. I stayed up all last night crying my eyes out - wondering why Mr. Kawasaki never talks about my chest...</summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/08/the_inside_scoo.html" title="Signum sine tinnitu--by Guy Kawasaki: Everything You Wanted to Know About Getting a Job in Silicon Valley But Didn't Know Who to Ask"&gt;Guy would never hire me&lt;/a&gt;. And you know what? I&amp;#8217;m fine with that. I stayed up all last night crying my eyes out - wondering why Mr. Kawasaki never talks about my chest. Today, those prayers were answered in tip #11 of &lt;em&gt;Everything You Wanted to Know About Getting a Job in Silicon Valley But Didn&amp;#8217;t Know Who to Ask&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confess your sins. If you did something stupid in your past, the company will find out, so it’s better if it finds out from you rather than from a search on the Internet. A tech entrepreneur once told me how he rented out his chest as a billboard and made $2,500 (it’s a long story). A woman that he met on Match.com found this out, and it was an issue. If a date can find this stuff from your past, you can bet an interviewer will. Hopefully, this makes you think twice about the stupid things you’re tempted do on MySpace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a href="http://www.rentmychest.com/" title="Rent My Chest"&gt;it was stupid&lt;/a&gt; - but I refuse to take my chest off the Internet until someone pays me a million dollars to do it. Guess we&amp;#8217;ll just have to live with the horror, eh? Guy is right about thinking twice before you put something (anything) online. Wanna know the truth? &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lockergnome/19912740/" title="Seattle PI (1) on Flickr - Photo Sharing!"&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a happy ending&lt;/a&gt;. I started renting my chest years before &lt;a href="http://ponzarelli.com/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="Latthanapon Indharasophang"  rel="external"&gt;Ponzi&lt;/a&gt; and I met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She found my profile on Match.com late one night and sent me a response almost immediately. It took me a day to get back to her, but I was sure to pass along my AIM handle for quicker correspondence. It wasn&amp;#8217;t too long before we started to blast messages back and forth on IM. Within the first ten minutes, she asked an innocent question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t have any naked pictures of your chest online, do you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTF?! Did she know me? I really didn&amp;#8217;t want to date someone who watched me on TechTV, read &lt;a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="Technology News"  rel="external"&gt;Lockergnome&lt;/a&gt;, etc. She asked this question because (apparently) a lot of guys upload &amp;#8220;studly&amp;#8221; photos of their greased-up chests to dating sites. I, however, didn&amp;#8217;t realize this - as I never peruse male profiles. To her query, I responded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know who I am? :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Ponzi took this question differently than the way I intended - as if I was asking: &amp;#8220;DON&amp;#8217;T you know who I am?&amp;#8221; She said she didn&amp;#8217;t know who I was, and so I sent her a link to &lt;a href="http://www.rentmychest.com/" title="Rent My Chest"&gt;RentMyChest.com&lt;/a&gt;. If she didn&amp;#8217;t laugh, I&amp;#8217;d have to throw her back into the sea. Long story short: we met the next day and have been with each other ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone doesn&amp;#8217;t like my chest, then I don&amp;#8217;t need them in my life. Guy referenced my chest without naming me, specifically - but I&amp;#8217;ve had ten friends send me the link in the past half hour. Are there really that many tech entrepreneurs renting their chests online?! I think Guy was afraid his Technorati ranking would dip if he made the correlation. No matter, I&amp;#8217;ve cleared about $10k with my chest so far - and that number is steadily climbing. Not so stupid, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way: Guy might be speaking at the next &lt;a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="Technology Conference"  rel="external"&gt;Gnomedex&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8230;

I&amp;#8217;ve been dinking with Google Analytics (Urchin), Enquisite, Mint, and HitTail. The problem with hosted stat services is that they don&amp;#8217;t track everything. Ken Spreitzer emailed me about FlashStats the other day, and I asked him if he had any kind of discount for my readers, and he responded in kind: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We would like to offer &lt;a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="Technology News"  rel="external"&gt;Lockergnome&lt;/a&gt; subscribers a 10% discount on the product through &lt;span style="color: red"&gt;September 15, 2006&lt;/span&gt;. The program costs $199 or $349. They can claim the discount by entering Gnome-10 in the Offer Code field. Or they can click on this link to visit our site and set a cookie which will remember this code for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="http://www.maximized.com/go/offer.asp?SrcId=gnome1&amp;#038;Coupon=Fs2006:Gnome-10&amp;#038;Go=Fs2006" title="Object moved"&gt;download a demo&lt;/a&gt; and give it a shot - FlashStats outputs ~60 different types of reports that you&amp;#8217;re not likely to get through a hosted stats solution.

      <summary>I think Jake&amp;#8217;s talking about arranging an eBook sale at some point in the near future...</summary>&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="http://www.jakeludington.com/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="Jake Ludington"  rel="external"&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8217;s talking about arranging an &lt;a href="http://tutorials.lockergnome.com/" title="http://tutorials.lockergnome.com/"&gt;eBook sale&lt;/a&gt; at some point in the near future. Until then, this offer will have to tide you word lovers over: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been a follower of &lt;a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/" title="http://www.lockergnome.com/"&gt;Lockergnome&lt;/a&gt; for several years now, going back to when it was the single newsletter. I&amp;#8217;m amazed at how you guys can still crank out quality info every day. I love it! I work in IT at a relatively low-end job, but it puts clothes on the kids, food on the table, and a roof over our heads. Best of all, I work nights and get to spend the days with the kids (sleep is something thats missing though). Along with technology and the kids, my real passion is writing (and reading). I&amp;#8217;ve written one novel and I&amp;#8217;m working on a second. I went the self publishing route using &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/" title="Lulu.com - Self Publishing - Free"&gt;LuLu.com&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;m really happy with them; the books look great. My only two wishes are for an editor and marketing guru. What i&amp;#8217;d like to do, if you are so inclined, is to offer the first twenty Gnomies to email me (&lt;a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="Lockergnome Subscriber"  rel="external"&gt;gnomie&lt;/a&gt; @ jasontjohnson.com) the PDF for free. If you want to check it out first, I have the &lt;a href="http://www.jasontjohnson.com/excerpt.html" title="Welcome to JasonTJohnson.com!"&gt;prologue and first few chapters&lt;/a&gt; online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a free eBook is certainly better than no eBook at all. If only I wasn&amp;#8217;t behind on my reading materials. Everybody, could you please not publish anything new this week? Thanks. I &amp;#8216;preciate it.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <summary>It&amp;#8217;ll crash if you look at it wrong, but at least we&amp;#8217;ll soon have Safari on Windows (no thanks to Apple)...</summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lockergnome/214621732/" title="Photo Sharing"&gt;&lt;img align="right" src="http://static.flickr.com/96/214621732_d6deecb38d_t.jpg" width="100" height="77" alt="Safari on Windows" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It&amp;#8217;ll crash if you look at it wrong, but at least we&amp;#8217;ll soon have Safari on Windows (no thanks to Apple). Get &lt;a HREF="http://www.getswift.org/"&gt;Swift&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;#8217;d like to take a look, but don&amp;#8217;t hold your breath for an amazing experience. It&amp;#8217;s going to take a year or so before Swift gets stable enough to use as an alternative to your already-alternative browser. Why we still have to deal with Safari at this point is beyond me. It&amp;#8217;s tough enough dealing with the inconsistences between Opera, IE7, and FireFox! I only know three people who use Safari in OS X by default, and they live in a mental institution. If you use Safari, too - please tell your sanitarium buddies I said &amp;#8220;Hello.&amp;#8221;

      <summary>Ponzi hates the WordPress admin interface - hates it to the point where she complains about it every time she views it...</summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ponzarelli.com/" title="Ponzi&amp;amp;#8217;s Schemes"&gt;Ponzi&lt;/a&gt; hates the WordPress admin interface - hates it to the point where she complains about it every time she views it. As such, I think she&amp;#8217;s decided to stop blogging (although she loves talking about blogging, she never actually gets around to doing it). I don&amp;#8217;t mind it with &lt;a href="http://www.ceprix.net/archives/spotmilk-admin-theme-for-wordpress/" title="http://www.ceprix.net/archives/spotmilk-admin-theme-for-wordpress/"&gt;SpotMilk&lt;/a&gt;, actually. Every time I go looking for a desktop blog management tool, I always go back to the original Web interface. The &lt;a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/" title="Writer Zone"&gt;Windows Live Writer&lt;/a&gt; is hoping to change all that, but they&amp;#8217;re not even close to winning me over (haphazard fonts, few customization options, built on the slow .NET platform, etc.). I think it&amp;#8217;ll be good at v3.0, but let&amp;#8217;s just see if &lt;a href="http://ponzarelli.com/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="Latthanapon Indharasophang"  rel="external"&gt;Ponzi&lt;/a&gt; likes v1.0. Until then, I&amp;#8217;ll continue to prepare posts in Outlook message windows. Anybody else giving this newly-released Windows Live Writer utility a stab - or comparing it against other clients like &lt;a href="http://wbloggar.com/" title="302 Found"&gt;w.Bloggar&lt;/a&gt; (which is also in sad need of updating)?

      <summary>We have a &amp;#8220;standard&amp;#8221; RSS icon and a similar working OPML icon, but I&amp;#8217;d like to work with the graphics community on creating a &amp;#8220;standard&amp;#8221; Tag icon and a &amp;#8220;standard&amp;#8221; Bookmark icon - in a similar square style...</summary>&lt;p&gt;We have a &amp;#8220;standard&amp;#8221; RSS icon and a similar working &lt;a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/2006/06/30/opml-icon/"&gt;OPML icon&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;#8217;d like to work with the graphics community on creating a &amp;#8220;standard&amp;#8221; Tag icon and a &amp;#8220;standard&amp;#8221; Bookmark icon - in a similar square style. These icons would tie into the functionality of my first two WP plugin ideas - where the user would only need to display one icon, and when the visitor hovers over it, would receive a nice callout to selected services. We could eliminate a massive amount of confusion and save page space at the same time. I think it&amp;#8217;s time we started thinking about this - but I&amp;#8217;m not a graphic designer. Help?

      <summary>I need to have some WordPress plugins developed, and I&amp;#8217;m sure the rest of the world would love &amp;#8216;em, too&amp;#8230; Take a look at any given Vox blog - when you hover over any given tag, you can view the results for that tag in specific local indices...</summary>&lt;p&gt;I need to have some WordPress plugins developed, and I&amp;#8217;m sure the rest of the world would love &amp;#8216;em, too&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 15px"&gt;Take a look at any given &lt;a href="http://leoville.vox.com/" title="LOL: The Life of Leo"&gt;Vox blog&lt;/a&gt; - when you hover over any given tag, you can view the results for that tag in specific local indices. I&amp;#8217;d like for someone to make a WP plugin that passes the tag to selected local AND external tag engines (Technorati, &lt;a href="http://tagjag.com/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="search"  rel="external"&gt;TagJag&lt;/a&gt;, Flickr, etc.).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 15px"&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to see a similar WP plugin for Bookmarking the post in the multitude of social engines (on hover, add to del.icio.us, Digg, Reddit, etc.). I don&amp;#8217;t wanna clutter my posts with hundreds of icons, and I believe this is plugin is also within the realm of possibility.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 15px"&gt;I need someone to create an expanded version of the &lt;a href="http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/Kramer" title="Kramer - WordPress Plugin Repository - Trac"&gt;Kramer&lt;/a&gt; WordPress plugin, so that it might take in link data from other blog search indices - Yahoo!, Ask, Feedster, Windows Live, Google Blogs, etc. Kramer really beefs up the discussion for any given post, but I really wanna kick that into overdrive.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 15px"&gt;What about a plugin that takes incoming search terms and auto-tags the post based on those terms (with or without moderation)? So, if a user searches for KeywordXYZ on Google and ultimately visits one of the blog entries, that blog entry will have the KeywordXYZ added to its tag list (via UTW or something).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 15px"&gt;I also need a WP tool that recursively goes through my posts which have not already been tagged, then tag the posts with keywords it finds most appropriate (either through the Yahoo! API or internal logic) - almost like how the &lt;a HREF="http://www.w-a-s-a-b-i.com/archives/2006/02/02/wordpress-related-entries-20/"&gt;Related Posts&lt;/a&gt; plugin works against the posts database automatically? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we&amp;#8217;re on the subject of WP, Automattic really needs to rename MUWP to something more human, like &amp;#8220;WordPress: Community Edition.&amp;#8221; Doesn&amp;#8217;t that position it better?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://tagjag.com/automattic" rel="tag"&gt;automattic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tagjag.com/javascript" rel="tag"&gt;javascript&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tagjag.com/keywords" rel="tag"&gt;keywords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tagjag.com/muwp" rel="tag"&gt;muwp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tagjag.com/plugins" rel="tag"&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tagjag.com/publishing" rel="tag"&gt;publishing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tagjag.com/tagging" rel="tag"&gt;tagging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://tagjag.com/wordpress" rel="tag"&gt;wordpress&lt;/a&gt;

      <summary>We use Hertz almost exclusively for car rentals these days - I think it&amp;#8217;s because they&amp;#8217;re a premier partner with American Express (which is our preferred plastic)...</summary>&lt;p&gt;We use Hertz almost exclusively for car rentals these days - I think it&amp;#8217;s because they&amp;#8217;re a premier partner with American Express (which is our preferred plastic). &lt;a href="http://ponzarelli.com/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="Latthanapon Indharasophang"  rel="external"&gt;Ponzi&lt;/a&gt; and I happen to travel a lot, so we rent cars from Hertz often. We always opt for a GPS-strapped vehicle, too. In the past few weeks, I&amp;#8217;ve experienced a few customer service snags with the car rental company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 15px"&gt;When we were in Texas for my brother&amp;#8217;s wedding, the Neverlost GPS directed us to the closest airport - which just so happened to be the wrong one. While I&amp;#8217;d rather have a nav system than go without, the Neverlost is a usability nightmare compared to more elegant systems that ship standard in, say, the Acura TSX.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 15px"&gt;Ponzi had to call Hertz to discuss a discrepancy, and the rep told her that she was privvy to a better car at a lower cost - even though the Web site she registered through didn&amp;#8217;t bother to say so. Dumb, dumb, dumb.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 15px"&gt;Through our business account, I reserved a Hertz car through the Web last week. The online form wanted to change the reservation name from mine to hers, and I had to re-edit the form before submitting it. When I arrived at SJC as a #1 Gold Club Member, they wouldn&amp;#8217;t let me leave the lot because I wasn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;Latthanapon Indharasophang.&amp;#8221; When I walked up to the counter, the agent was accusing me of not using the Web form properly - and that it was my fault. I&amp;#8217;m a &amp;#8220;#1 Gold Club&amp;#8221; member, which apparently means I get treated like shit quicker than non-members.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 15px"&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t add my name to our account, and it doesn&amp;#8217;t look like we can change Ponzi&amp;#8217;s name in there without divine intervention. Dumb, dumb, dumb.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-bottom: 15px"&gt;Ponzi jockeyed her car behind mine before leaving to Los Angeles last week, and I can&amp;#8217;t move it because I don&amp;#8217;t have her alarm fob. I called Hertz to arrange a local rental, and the operator asserted that they&amp;#8217;d reimburse my cab fare to the office. When I called the downtown location, the local clerk told me to wait a few hours (again, I ask the value of being in the &amp;#8220;#1 Gold Club&amp;#8221;). I arrived, paid $15 for the fare, and waited in line. The guy was only able to reimburse only $8 (but made it $10 because he was &amp;#8220;feeling like being nice&amp;#8221;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Hertz was blogging, I&amp;#8217;d send &amp;#8216;em a trackback.

      <summary>A few days ago, I told the Lockergnome clan that I was panelizing for SIPA&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;Blogging and Beyond&amp;#8217; session...</summary>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I told the &lt;a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/"  class="alinks_links" onclick="return alinks_click(this);" title="Technology News"  rel="external"&gt;Lockergnome&lt;/a&gt; clan that I was panelizing for &lt;a href="http://www.sipa.org/augevents.htm" title="Welcome to SIPA"&gt;SIPA&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;Blogging and Beyond&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; session. In doing so, I got to meet folks like &lt;a href="http://wisezen.blogspot.com/" title="Anshu's Blog on The Business of Software"&gt;Anshu Sharma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://siteindia.com/blog" title="301 Moved Permanently"&gt;Pradeep Sethi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mychurch.org/" title="MyChurch.org | Church Profile"&gt;Joe Suh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://agaurav.spaces.live.com/" title="Gaurav's world"&gt;Gaurav Agarwal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://adeology.blogspot.com/" title="Adeology"&gt;Aditya Kothadiya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ramitsethi.com/" title="http://www.ramitsethi.com/"&gt;Ramit Sethi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8230; as well as &lt;a href="http://blog.lifebeyondcode.com/" title="Beyond Code"&gt;Rajesh Setty&lt;/a&gt; (who recently launched &lt;a href="http://www.suggestica.com/" title="Suggestica: Suggestions from Trusted Authorities"&gt;Suggestica&lt;/a&gt;). The event was pretty casual, which was much appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experto crede&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/" title="Guy Kawasaki"&gt;The Guy&lt;/a&gt; was amazing, too. Yes, I met &lt;strong&gt;THE&lt;/strong&gt; Guy Kawasaki. He&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;genius level&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;a capite ad calcem&lt;/em&gt;, so my antics only served to bolster his &lt;em&gt;ductus exemplo&lt;/em&gt;. My responses were more in the &lt;em&gt;audere est facere&lt;/em&gt; flavor, while Guy remained fully &lt;em&gt;compos mentis&lt;/em&gt; - waxing &lt;em&gt;ex animo&lt;/em&gt; frequently. Even so, we moved discussion forward &lt;em&gt;pari passu&lt;/em&gt; - remembering &lt;em&gt;nemo nisi per amicitiam cognoscitur&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;nosce te ipsum&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Odi et amo&lt;/em&gt; blogging - with &lt;em&gt;opera omnia&lt;/em&gt; in the Web archives. And to all the would-be future bloggers out there, I give to you a single phrase: &lt;em&gt;illegitimi non carborundum&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Orta recens quam pura nites&lt;/em&gt;!

Unbelievable. They&amp;#8217;re playing on our fears to take away our freedoms. Does that sound right to you? Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong: I&amp;#8217;m very thankful that officials in the UK were able to stop terrorists a few hours ago. But it&amp;#8217;s not just your life that&amp;#8217;s at risk now - it&amp;#8217;s your civil liberties. Yes, I agree - we should be on high alert, but not for the reasons they&amp;#8217;re spoon-feeding to us. Media propoganda is in full swing; scare tactics only serve to manipulate you and public opinion.

We&amp;#8217;re going to get kicked out of our hotel room any minute now, and will need to seek shelter this afternoon. I&amp;#8217;d rather not sit in a Starbucks for hours on end, but unless we can identify a place in San Jose (Mountain View, Cupertino) where free WiFi is available, I don&amp;#8217;t know if we have much of a choice. I&amp;#8217;d rather not pay for WiFi when I know wireless Internet access is free elsewhere. I&amp;#8217;ll be checking email through my phone, so feel free to comment if you know of a great place for us to land (so to speak).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/em&gt; Looks like we&amp;#8217;ll be on Microsoft&amp;#8217;s campus this afternoon, after lunch - hanging with &lt;a href="http://www.windowsmedia.org/" title="Object moved"&gt;Joel Schonbrunn&lt;/a&gt;. If there are any other &amp;#8217;softies down here, we&amp;#8217;ll be happy to say hello!

One of the key pathogens in the sickness that has corrupted Congress:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whether you're a blogger, a curious citizen, a citizen journalist, a muckraker, or a journalist, we need your help. &lt;p&gt;There are more than &lt;a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/node/exposingearmarks"&gt;1,800 earmarks&lt;/a&gt; in the 2007 appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education (see &lt;a href="http://sunlightlabs.com/earmarks/"&gt;the map&lt;/a&gt;). That's over 1,800 appropriations that have never been publicly debated -- and probably never will be -- and we don't even know where they came from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An earmark is a line-item that is inserted into a bill to direct funds to a specific project or recipient without any public hearing or review. (Read the Earmarks FAQ.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Sunlight Foundation along with &lt;a href="http://councilfor.cagw.org/"&gt;Citizens Against Government Waste&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://porkbusters.org/hhsearmarks.php"&gt;Porkbusters.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.humanevents.com/rightangle/index.php?id=15532&amp;title=exposing_earmarks_one_by_one"&gt;Human Events Online&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.clubforgrowth.org/2006/08/the_new_pork_database.php"&gt;Club for Growth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/"&gt;Heritage Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/a-220449~Editorial__Spending_money_behind_closed_doors_.html"&gt;the Examiner Newspapers,&lt;/a&gt; have pulled together a &lt;a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/files/full_earmarks_cleaned.xls"&gt;database of the earmarks&lt;/a&gt;. We're all asking you to help make sense of the information (if you've got alot of time, here are &lt;a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/earmarksresearchquestions"&gt;a bunch of questions to ask&lt;/a&gt; of the earmarks).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check out our interactive &lt;a href="http://sunlightlabs.com/earmarks/"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; of the earmarks put together by the Sunlight Labs, and you'll see there are gaps in the data. Where do these earmarks come from? Which earmark comes from which Member of Congress? Is your Member of Congress responsible for any of these? Take 10 minutes to call your Lawmakers office and find out whether any of the Labor HHS earmarks come from his/her office, and then come back to this blog post and report it. Thanks!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>http://www.smartmobs.com/archive/2006/08/15/smartmobbing_co.html</entry>

Herein a collection of personal modifications, folk innovations, street customization, ad hoc alterations, wear-patterns, home-made versions and indigenous ingenuity. In short -- stuff as it is actually used, and not how its creators planned on it being used. As William Gibson said, "The street finds its own uses for technology." I welcome suggestions of links, and contributions from others to include in this compendium. -- KK &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/streetuse/archives/2006/08/where_are_the_pay_phones.php"&gt;Where Are the Pay Phones?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When everyone has a cell phone, what happens to pay phones? They adapt to compete. Not everyone does have a cell phone, yet, so those without one want an easier way to make calls rather than struggle with broken phones in booths that don't take the coins you may have. In China, an overhead sign indicates this tiny store will sell you a call on their working phone. Win-win for everyone.

      <title>I'm on a banana roll lately</title>
      <author/>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;I'm on something of a banana-eating roll lately. I'm trying to eat very healthful food these days, so I've added more fruit to my diet. Now I'm eating a banana a day and wondering why I didn't before. They're so easy to eat and yummy, full of carbs (which I do not eschew), vitamins A, B, and C, and they contain high levels of potassium. Also they have fiber, and most people don't get enough fiber. They're almost like the perfect food. So when I spotted this recipe for &lt;a href="http://www.epicurious.com/bonappetit/blogs/editor/2006/08/chocolatecovere.html" title="Chocolate-Covered Bananas"&gt;Chocolate-Covered Bananas&lt;/a&gt;, I thought, "Hmm...maybe I can add more bananas to my diet!" I know chocolate goes against the healthful claim above, but bittersweet chocolate is supposed to be good for you. So in some ways, by making a chocolate-covered banana, you're making an extra-healthy banana!&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Report from Wisconsin</title>
      <author/>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;There's not a lot to report from my visit to America's heartland except this astounding fact: heirloom tomatoes are cheaper than regular tomatoes! The first night we were in Wisconsin, we went to the local farmer's market. One stand was selling both heirloom and regular tomatoes. The regulars were $2/lb and the heirlooms were $1/lb. $1 a pound! Can you believe it? At Union Square, they're between $4-5/lb, depending on the vendor. I guess they're cheaper than regulars because they're less popular out there. We took advantage of the price and bought a bunch for dinner the next night, and they were mighty tasty.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Questioning the value of seasonal eating</title>
      <author/>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=102#more-102" title="Out of Season"&gt;Frank Bruni questions whether seasonal eating is all that everyone claims&lt;/a&gt; but a commenter says it best: "Unseasonal eating is fine, depending on what season you’re talking about: Sausages in summer is a matter of taste, while tomatoes in January is unsustainable eating." Of course, in place of "unsustainable eating," I would have simply said "gross."&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

The simple design lets you grind with one hand, so that you can use your other hand for stirring if you want. Another ingenious aspect of its design is the way you fill it. You twist the tube to reveal a hole, and in doing so, rotate the "ears" towards he back. Then you can lay the peppergun on the counter, supported by the ears at the back, with the hole pointed toward you, and easily fill with sea salt or whole peppercorns. I've used lots of different pepper grinders in my day, but this is far and away my favorite. Easy to use. Easy to refill. Easy to clean. I love it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.megnut.com/2006/07/gadget-foil-cutter" title="Gadget: Foil Cutter"&gt;Previous gadget: Foil Cutter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Virtual Machine Tips</title>
      <link>http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2006/08/15/virtual_mach/</link>
      <summary>A quick follow up to yesterday's post about Parallels. When you create a virtual install of Windows on your Mac, Parallels creates a file. Your OS, applications, and data all live within this file. Upon installing (and activating) a fresh copy of Windows and all your various applications, make a duplicate of this file. It'll be a gigabyte or two in size, depending on how much you've added, but you can easily store it on a backup drive or DVD. There are a few reasons to do this. If you're worried about exposing your Mac to Windows worms and virii, you now have a backup you can restore from at any point. Just move any important data out of the corrupted Windows install, delete it, and make a clone of the backup. Whether that's easier or harder than maintaining anti-virus software on your copy of Windows entirely depends on how you use it. It's easier for me, anyway, since my data lives on the Mac portion of my hard drive. Or if you take the IE team's advice to heart and decide to maintain multiple versions of Windows for the purposes of testing multiple versions of IE (something I've yet to be convinced is necessary, by the way), you can simply clone a few copies of your backup and vary your IE installs between them. This is all possible with Virtual PC as well, incidentally. The files are much larger, though.</summary>

      <summary>Browser-testing in Windows, on a G5 Mac using VirtualPC: Save your latest change. Cmd + Tab to switch to VirtualPC Go get a coffee while waiting for a response from your virtualized copy of Windows. Hit Refresh in the top-most browser. Go get another coffee while waiting for your virtualized copy of Internet Explorer to render the page. Take your time, you've got plenty to spare. Come back and check the results. Didn't do what you expected, did it? That's IE for you. Figure out what to change in your code, then go back to 1 and start again. Net time: an ice age or two. Brower-testing in Windows, on an Intel-based Mac using Parallels Desktop for Mac: Save your latest change. Cmd + Tab to switch to Parallels instantaneously. Hit Refresh in the top-most browser. Come back and check the results. Didn't do what you expected, did it? That's IE for you. Figure out what to change in your code, then go back to 1 and start again. Net time: a blink of an eye for the refresh, but the bug-hunting still takes just as long as ever. Because the second list still contains a few steps, it's very difficult to convey to you just how fast Parallels runs. Click through to this YouTube demo for an example, though you'll need extra software in the form of Virtual Desktop Manager or similar for the same effect. Windowed or full-screen however, Parallels allows you to switch to Windows, refresh the browser, and get back to your actual work all within the space of a thought. Testing for Windows used to be drudgery under VirtualPC; with the sheer speed of Parallels, I'm actually enjoying browser-testing right now (though the novelty will die off soon, no doubt). I'm becoming more and more convinced that the new Intel-based Macs are the ultimate web designer's companion, and I'm clearly not alone in my thinking.

      <summary>An interesting question came up the other day -- why do I name my hard drives the way I do? I currently run two partitions on all my machines (and name them consistently), and a pair of backup Firewire drives: Sparkle The main OS &amp; applications partition Shine A secondary partition to store any personal data, a system which I vastly prefer over the default of dumping all my files into my user folder. Gloss The main backup drive. Glitter The secondary backup drive. You may see a thread here -- I operate under the business name of Bright Creative, so the drive names are alliterative synonyms derived from "Bright". (With the [questionable] added bonus that Sparkle &amp;amp; Shine was a hit by a local band in the 90's.) I suspect drive names, and the reasons why people come up with them, could be a fascinating conversation. Let's get it started. Tell me what you call your drives, and why.</summary>

      <link>http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2006/08/07/clearertype/</link>
      <summary>A nice new feature of IE7 I noticed last week: ClearType is now a browser-specific feature. When Windows XP was released in 2001, Microsoft launched ClearType as a way of smoothing on-screen fonts. Great, except for some reason, it was off by default. Most users never found the setting to enable it, so for the past 5 years, we've still had to assume users are seeing ugly pixellated fonts on the web. But Vista aside, even in the forthcoming IE7 for XP, ClearType is a browser-specific setting and it's enabled by default. Combine this with IE7's presumed quick march onto user's systems, and we're going to see a whole lot of ClearType in the near future. Nicely done, IE team.</summary>

      <summary>Here we go. According to CNET, Internet Explorer 7 is going to be sent out automatically to XP users as a priority Windows Update upon its launch. We'll see a massive migration, and IE6 numbers will take a sharp dive in the very near future. This is a good thing. However, a sharp surge of immediate adoption could be a little painful for those not currently testing in IE7; now is most definitely the time to start, if that's you. (Hey, don't feel bad, I still only have IE7 beta 1 myself.) Also, as of the launch (no set date yet, some time in Q4 is the current best guess), I have a strong feeling the case for testing in IE5.x will be unjustifiably hard to make in most cases.

Many gathered Wednesday at Digital Hollywood 2006 in San Jose, Calif., to hear the pros talk about the future of media online. Many feel that the television and movie studios will increasingly move to the online market. One such member, Brian E. Taptich, the vice president of business development at BitTorrent, talks with CNET News.com's Neha Tiwari about how his company is leading the trend in the industry. What's the future for online video sharing? Will studios and the online community live in copyright harmony? &lt;br clear="all" /&gt;</summary>

My one point of disagreement is about the TCK; an open-source TCK just causes confusion; what is really needed is a TCK that anyone is allowed to run. Unfortunately, much of the discussion in this area ignores governance and community; while thinking about this I realized what may be a principle of open source: don't have a license that encourages something that your governance discourages, or vice versa. (This also relates to spec licensing: if you want people to fork your spec like crazy, by all means put it under a Creative Commons license. If you don't, don't. But don't mix them.)</summary>

      <title>CHI 2006: Using Intelligent Task Routing and Contribution Review to Help Communities Build Artifacts of Lasting Value</title>
      <link>http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2006/04/27.html#a1759</link>
      <summary>&lt;a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/%7Ecosley/"&gt;Dan Cosley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;(I think): &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;br style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Here are the takeaways I hope you will get from my talk: &lt;br&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Artifacts of lasting value matter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Designing for contribution is interesting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Modeling value over time is useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intelligent task routing works. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities like IMDB, RateYourMusic (35,000 people), and Wikipedia are building collective artifacts of lasting value. But not all communities succeed. Nupedia, how many smaller groups have faltered. Grouplens is kinda failing because everyone is using a different format. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Often, one enthusiastic guy does all this work of setting up the system, inviting users, maintaining, etc. You know, like Chad adds all the movies in MovieLens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you ideally want many people to do work. The virtues of the many: Scale (SlashDot), Speed (Wikipedia repairs &amp;lt; 3min), Robustness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But... users say, "I don't want to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;add &lt;/span&gt;movies, I want them to be there for me." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CommunityLab is researchers from CMU, UMich and UMinn. We contribute theory insights and design ideas.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I want to talk about creating value in a specific community, the MovieLens community. When we started this project we had 8800 movies x 8 fields = 70,000 fields to fill, 23,000 of which were empty. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to do it? Part I of my talk is about &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;contribution reviews&lt;/span&gt;. We know that editing improves quality. Very often, in an editing process, you don't see the internals. You don't see how the sausage is made - it's pre-publication review. Wiki-like processes let people publish right away. We wondered which of those models (let people provide information and add a reviewing step, or not) would help the fields fill up faster. We tested it empirically.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As it turns out, wiki-like beats pre-publication review short term, and in both cases contributions taper over time. In the wiki model, quality hits an equilibrium, a steady state where the good elements and bad elements balance each other. Our model says that in the long run, it actually doesn't matter if review is pre- or post-publication - you reach the same state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part II of my talk is about &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;intelligent task routing. &lt;/span&gt;How do people find tasks to perform in the system? Randomly (e.g. Slashdot metamoderation), chronologically, alphabetically? These kinda suck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to help people find work they want to do. People often work on their interests - match people with tasks they'll like. Karay &amp;amp; Williams' collective effort model deals with social loafing. They posit that people decide whether to contribute according to how much it benefits them, the group, and whether the contribution matters to the group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assigned people to four groups; in each group people were given tasks according to different algorithms. We found that four times as many contributions were made into MovieLens if we asked them to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;fill in information about movies they were among the few to have seen. &lt;/span&gt;"This Needs Work" did not work so well as a motivator in terms of number of movies, but if you count the fields filled it's pretty good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this work I made SuggestBot, which suggests Wikipedia articles you might like to edit, and is intended to optimize participant contributions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Q. (Alain D&amp;eacute;silets, NRC) You asked people to edit movies they had not seen? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. Yes, 3 of the 4 groups didn't depend on whether they had seen the movie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Q. (me) So your model predicted that eventually the good slows down and the bad balances it out - does that mean that eventually there are effectively no contributions being made to the system? Do you assume that the amount of uncharted territory is constant?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;(The answers confused me. I think Dan basically said "yes, sorta" to both questions.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>CHI 2006: Phases of Use: A Means to Identify Factors that Influence Product Utilization</title>
      <link>http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2006/04/26.html#a1758</link>
      <summary>&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Edward Bosma: &lt;/span&gt;My company, Oc&amp;eacute;, is a kind of Xerox for the Netherlands. We have &amp;gt;24,000 employees in 80 countries. &lt;p&gt; At Oc&amp;eacute; we know how to design for use (fit to the task, make it easy to learn and efficient to use)... but this does not guarantee product success. &lt;br&gt;Sometimes the product is not installed correctly, does not fit with how people work, etc.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How do we design, not for use, but for experience? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We see experience with a product as a process. Identifying phases in this process can help to understand experience. We identified these phases, partly based on communication science and experience: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Exposure: &lt;/span&gt;The product becomes available and fully operational. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Awareness: &lt;/span&gt;user gets first impression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Motivation: &lt;/span&gt;user finds a reason to learn more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Orientation:&lt;/span&gt; user is getting to know how it works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Adoption: &lt;/span&gt;user applies the product in real life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Incorporation: &lt;/span&gt;use of the product becomes part of normal behaviour. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We looked at our past mistakes. We postulated that all preceding phases must be passed successfully to reach a given phase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Design for exposure: ensure your product will become available and fully operational for the intended users. When we introduced a digital multifunction unit that would print as well as copy but looked almost identical to the analog, copy-only unit, we realized that people were still printing on the inferior, small desktop printer. We did a redesign that made people more aware of the product's affordances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Design for motivation: seduce intended users. Think about how a product can address current problems, basic human needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Design for orientation: We threw in a tutorial and some small tests for better retention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Design for adoption: make users apply the product in their real-life situation. What can withhold them from doing so? We must raise trust and confidence that everything will go right, at each step along the way. For this printer &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;(shows behemoth piece of machinery) &lt;/span&gt;we implemented an initial phase in which the machine will only print the next job when the operator confirms that the previous job was successful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Design for incorporation: build a long-term relationship between product and user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. How do you balance ease of learning with efficiency? Have you considered having different interfaces for different users? What about the idea of having a barcode that I can use to reinstate settings I use often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A. Requirements may conflict; our paper says you have to strike a balance among all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comment. Alan Cooper suggested a sliding panel. I'd love to see a copier that has something like that - a fat copy button and a panel that hides/reveals the complexity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comment. (Xerox guy). Do you have a product planning department? My observation has been that sometimes it's a battle between the usability guys and the marketing folks who want the new features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. How do you measure adoption rates for this kind of product? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A. We have no quantitative data. This is based on field experience, sitting down with customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. In your scenario, probably the buyers are different from the users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A. Good question. We focus on the end users. Our goal is not that the product be sold, it's that it be used properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Looks like a quite sensible model, will be helpful in structuring my thinking about the process of adoption.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;</summary>

      <title>CHI 2006: Games &amp; Performance session</title>
      <link>http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2006/04/25.html#a1757</link>
      <summary>&lt;a href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/research/publications/files/5599.pdf"&gt;Alone Together? Exploring the Social Dynamics of Massively Multiplayer Online Games&lt;/a&gt; is the title of a very interesting study of World of Warcraft (WoW) social dynamics by Nicolas Ducheneaut and collaborators. The talk was given in an overcrowded room. I was standing and couldn't take notes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically they used WoW's open API to scrape data about hundreds of thousands of players on five servers, registering who was present where and when and what character they were playing. The paper is surely worth a look if you're interested in online social interaction patterns from data. If you dislike PDFs, a few of the findings seem to be &lt;a href="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2006/02/alone_together_.html"&gt;in this blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Big kudos to the team for doing their research openly on the &lt;a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/"&gt;playon blog&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next I listened to a talk about &lt;a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/%7Ematthew/papers/CHIYoshiWithCopyright.pdf"&gt;Interweaving Mobile Games With Everyday Life&lt;/a&gt;, which dealt with an urban multiplayer PocketPC game called Feed the Yoshi. It gave me some game ideas for the Ile Sans Fil community wireless project. Something to discuss with &lt;a href="http://mtl3p.ilesansfil.org"&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt;... Transcript follows.&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Presenter:&lt;/span&gt; We had two foci in this work: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Weaving ubiquitous computing into 'the fabric of everyday life". What happens if you use a system over a long time?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seams and seamful design. Seams are gaps and 'losses in translation' in digital media. We actually argue for seamful design. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt; WiFi varies in position, range and access controls. There are gaps, overlaps, passwords, fees for commercial hotspots, legal constraints. Those are Seams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We made a game that exploits seamful design. It's implemented on PDAs (HP iPAQs) so you can play everywhere. The game is called &lt;a href="http://www.yoshigame.com/"&gt;Feeding Yoshi&lt;/a&gt;. A Yoshi is a critter that eats fruit. Players feed them for points. You can also sow seeds at empty plantations. Fruits grow in them, and you can pick them up and put them on your basket. Yoshis and plantations are scattered across the city. Players carry fruit to the Yoshis. Yoshis and plantations are 802.11 access points. Yoshis are actually locatedat secure access points and plantations are at open points. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's a map of Glasgow, we did some wardriving and found 483 points. You get more points for feeding Yoshis multiple fruits. You can swap fruits with other players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Points are submitted to the game web site via 'codes'. The site shows a leaderboard. The game uses p2p ad-hoc networks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To study Yoshi, we had 4 teams of 4 in Derby, Nottingham and Glasgowplay it over 7 days. Players had various backgrounds. Our data comes fromdiaries, interviews, logs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Shows a video diary of a player beginning his day, leaving for work, finding a strawberry tree.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall the players found the game fun to play, engaging, worth taking time out for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patterns of play reflected life/work styles. There was a large spread in the length of play sessions. Journeys were often good for play. Players built an understanding of where the Yoshis and plantations were on their routes to work. One player came up with the concept of the 'Drive-by Yoshi', wherein a friend would drive himaround and he could rack up points efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Work was actually both a resource and a constraint. You could use work's WiFi. People's jobs sometimes allowed them to take breaks, be late, slip out. Work habits were not a predictor of success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The coupling with location led to awareness of urban character and conversation with other players. On crowded streets players would "run into folks". There were distinctive patterns of movement - shuttling back and forth, etc. People felt uneasy just hanging around suburban homes, and uncomfortable in industrial and business districts. Some areas were felt "too dangerous to play in". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The social setting affects coordination and collaboration, both with other players and with non-players. One player's movement patterns annoyed his girfriend greatly. Play eventually bridged teams, even though members of the different teams didn't know one another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reflections. Should players be forced to move out of rich areas? It might encourage mobility. Were some locations 'too good'? Should we support play 'at speed'? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Future work involves seams in software and eHealth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This was the first study of a long-term mobile game. The quality of play was flexible with everyday life. Players augmented existing routines and established new ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you have any questions I'm sure my coauthors will be really happy to answer them. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. You didn't actually require transmission over the hotspots? So you could have tied this to arbitrary locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A. We wanted people to actually learn something about wireless networks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. This work is a great opportunity for exploration. Glasgow gets a lot of rain. Have you thought about extra rewards for people who go out and feed the Yoshis in the pouring rain? Have you thought about introducing a predator? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A. They're cool ideas. The first I'm sure we could implement using weather reports. If the game had more characters, some of which are unveiled over time, it might make the game more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. Tell us about how much people modified their normal routine? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A. At the end most people told us they actually altered their routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. How long does it take for plantations to grow? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A. It's immediate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. Have you considered making them more tamagochi-like, where you can have your yoshis grow and evolve &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A. We did. (Said some more things.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. What are the system requirements? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A. You can download the game for any PocketPC from the website. We'vegot thousands of downloads, it's getting quite popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. (Google guy). This looks like a great way of providing incentives for people to go to certain locations, open their wifi networks, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A. Well, there's probably a business in there. Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>CHI 2006: Dogear, Social Bookmarking for the Enterprise</title>
      <link>http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2006/04/25.html#a1756</link>
      <summary>&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;(Notes from a talk about &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://domino.watson.ibm.com/cambridge/research.nsf/242252765710c19485256979004d289c/1c181ee5fbcf59fb852570fc0052ad75"&gt;IBM's Dogear.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Social bookmarking is a central store, where you can put keywords (tags), discover via "pivot" browsing, and subscribe to link feeds. &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt; Going to the enterprise: (1) authentication (no anonymity - promotes more responsible work), (2) internet and intranet bookmarks, (3) support for both shared and private bookmarks (this was a subject of debate among us), (4) designed for remixing (REST and dogear api) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interface: select text, right-click and pick "Dogear this" or click the dogear bookmarklet. Window pops up, with Title - Tags - Description - URL - Private? checkbox (default is public so there is a little extra cost in going private). Below, recommended, popular, and recent tags for this URL, and a visual indicator of how popular the link is &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All Users' Bookmarks display page has a different styling than personal lists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tweak in the enterprise seach engine (w3): show Dogear results before the w3 results (looks like corporate intranet search is not so good and they wanted to let the poor searchers help one another). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REST style: substitute the /html for /atom or /js in URLs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuse: in the Dogear developer's blog, through a few lines of Javascript, his latest Dogears are listed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Field trial results. Friendly trial began in March. In July: IBM Technology Adoption Program (TAP) launch, dogear included. Out of 686 visitors, 185 created bookmarks, 350 clicked on a link in the first 8 weeks. Sustained growth over 30 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content makeup: 56% is shared internet, 38% is shared intranet, 2% private intranet, 3% private intranet bookmarks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early survey results show benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Good buzz in the IBM intranet blogosphere: 94 unique posters mentioning dogear. When a new feature or mashup shows up there is renewed buzz. There's a whole new ecosystem around adoption of tools in the networked enterprise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tags reveal groups of people interested in similar topics. There are still around 10% new tags every week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Next steps are to investigate social navigation through pivot browsing, folksonomy development, role-based portals, integration with other software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. Did you make an effort to reduce number of tags by providing recommendations? A. There is still debate over whether this would be a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. Did users continue to use their own browser bookmarks? Do you have data? A. Some folks are interested in putting their dogear bookmarks out on the internet. I'm one of those who stopped using browser bookmarks, I'm sure there are others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. Sharing? A. There were some comments about the benefits of using other people's bookmarks, and also about the . It's really low-cost sharing for the organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. My team has used a common tag that was used by all on the team. Other ideas? A. Once you see tagging existing both on bookmarking systems, blogs, etc., you start asking about a tag repository in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;(Had a nice chat with &lt;a href="http://www.mrfeinberg.com/"&gt;Dogear programmer Jonathan Feinberg&lt;/a&gt; after the session, where we talked about the next step of enabling &lt;a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22ridiculously+easy+group-forming%22&amp;amp;start=0&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official"&gt;ridiculously easy group-forming&lt;/a&gt; in Dogear, among other things.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tag: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/CHI2006" rel="tag"&gt;&lt;var&gt;chi2006&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</summary>

      <title>CHI 2006 course: Jared Spool, "Designing for the Scent of Information"</title>
      <link>http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2006/04/25.html#a1755</link>
      <summary>&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/author/jared/"&gt;Jared Spool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; has been working on usability for eons. It's the second time I've &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sebpaquet/7028070/"&gt;run into him&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; in Montreal. Entertaining speaker. I wrote down the points that stood out for me.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scent &lt;/span&gt;is what users are looking for. Scent should be reinforced as you get closer to what you're looking for. &amp;nbsp;The three-click rule - "everything must be reachable in three clicks" is bunk. On most ecommerce sites you need four clicks to do anything. Users tolerate clicking more if they get reinforcement along the way.&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Iceberg effect: &lt;/span&gt;The user assumes that what is above the fold is representative of what is below, so won't scroll if they don't find what they're looking for above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; Banner blindness: &lt;/span&gt;Based on experience, we are trained to ignore the top 60 pixels of a page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People would rather click than search. Amazon is an exception, they have trained us not to expect scent on the home page. Amazon's nav panel is scentless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content created from the provider's perspective is a scent-killer. If your links refer to your specialized vocabulary but your users do not master it, they won't get where they need to go.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt; Trigger words&lt;/span&gt; lead users to click when they recognize them. If they don't see a trigger word, they will type it into your search engine. To find trigger words you're missing on your site, you turn on your search logs and you look at what users input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Short links don't emit scent. The best links are 7-12 words. Too few words, you probably won't hit a trigger word. Too many, the user just can't see it in all that text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Keep your pages short, because you don't want users to scroll". Untrue. There's only so much that you can put on one page. The most successful pages are very long, about 10 screens long. NYT has just gone to a 3,000 pixel high home page.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are designs that stop users from scrolling. A horizontal rule; tiny print; side-by-side columns of text that end exactly at the same point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sometimes the site map actually gives off more scent than the home page. Unfortunately the link to the site map is itself scentless. If your logs tell you a lot of people are going to your site map, try making it the home page for a day. Chances are you'll get rave compliments on your redesign!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some scents throw you off, violating your expectations, actually sending you away from where you're going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are three types of graphics on web sites: navigation graphics, content graphics, ornamental graphics. Graphics can sometimes communicate scent, too. &lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>CHI 2006: CHI Madness</title>
      <link>http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2006/04/24.html#a1754</link>
      <summary>This year the CHI conference is experimenting with how the (impressively heavy, 8-track wide, and that's just the papers) day schedules are presented to attendees, and they came up with a refreshing idea. Every morning they will line up 42 speakers to present 21 hours' worth of scholarly content, each being alloted 40 seconds to attract listeners to their talk. The end product is packaged as the CHI Madness session. &lt;p&gt;I find the idea deeply clueful. This gives people an occasion to briefly pitch their findings to an audience on the scale of a thousand. Normally you're able to do this only with a handful of people, during hallway or reception conversations. and I expect it will help better match presenters with attendees and perhaps spread attendance a bit more evenly. I also think the exercise of distilling to a 30-second pitch will probably help improve the presentations themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We just had the first such session. I feared that it would be tedious, but the pacing and variety make it just right. It's fascinating to see how different researchers condense and pitch their papers, both visually and aurally. Academics are often slow to get to the point, so this is an enlightening exercise. Some are more skillful than others. Most are pretty creative, so the few Powerpoint lists filled with bullets and people who read their abstracts look a bit stodgy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One researcher hilariously pitched his paper as an 8-round wrestling match between - wait for it - documentation methodologies. The &lt;a href="http://research.microsoft.com/adapt/sis/phlat.htm"&gt;Phlat&lt;/a&gt; guy closed with the slogan, "It's Phlat, it' phat, yo." One guy's &lt;a href="http://dis.shef.ac.uk/stevewhittaker/chi2006_whittaker_final.pdf"&gt;temporal compression work&lt;/a&gt; was ideally suited to the medium, so his pitch was pretty effective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tag: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/chi2006" rel="tag"&gt;&lt;var&gt;chi2006&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</summary>

      <title>CHI 2006: Scott Cook (Intuit)</title>
      <link>http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/2006/04/24.html#a1753</link>
      <summary>&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CHI conference is in my hometown this week, and &lt;a href="http://www.socialtext.com"&gt;Socialtext&lt;/a&gt; is graciously sending me downtown to learn some stuff. Intuit founder Scott Cook opened the conference. Here are my notes from his talk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;[Update: what follows is more of an impressionistic transcript; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.antonellapavese.com/"&gt;Antonella Pavese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; put up a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.antonellapavese.com/archive/2006/04/178/"&gt;really nice "annotated reconstruction" of Scott Cook's CHI talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;, complete with pictures and all - go see it!]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Speaker intro (paraphrased)&lt;/span&gt;: In 1984 Scott Cook founded Intuit, which makes the famously successful Quicken software and is among the first companies to have a &lt;a href="http://eastwikkers.typepad.com/eastwikkers_/2006/04/33_wikis_17_the.html"&gt;public wiki&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.taxalmanac.org/index.php/Main_Page"&gt;Tax Almanac&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Scott Cook:&lt;/span&gt; Je suis heureux d'etre ici aujourd'hui. Mon francais... not so good. In preparing for this, my wife told me not to worry about being charming, clever or intellectual. "Just be yourself", she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the best examples of game-changing invention hails from here in Quebec. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Lalibert%C3%A9"&gt;Guy Laliberte&lt;/a&gt; founded &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirque_du_Soleil"&gt;Cirque du Soleil&lt;/a&gt; 25 years ago. It became a huge business. They did this in a market that anyone would have said was down. They were asking for more money than the Wringley Brothers were asking. They didn't steal Wringley's customers. They invented a new kind of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 3M used to sell sandpaper. Employee &lt;a href="http://www.3m.com/about3m/pioneers/drew.jhtml"&gt;Dick Drew&lt;/a&gt; was in an automobile shop, heard a worker complain that he couldn't remove the tape without taking the fresh paint off, too. Then he'd need to sand a lot. This led him to invent the masking tape (even though his boss didn't want him to), and later on, the cellophane tape, which turned 3M into a huge business.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Said Peter Drucker: "The bottleneck is always at the top of the bottle".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What kind of company are you building? That depens on your model of innovation. Here are five: (1) the lone genius (the Edison / Bell model); (2) the boss is the genius (popular among some Silicon Valley CEOs); (3) copy competitors' inventions; (4) Cloister the geniuses in a lab - but the innovation never seems to make it into a product; (5) make your people the geniuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The model I prefer is the last one. The people who are in close contact with customers are the unit of innovation. Managers' jobs are to create the greenhouse, enable those little teams to form around customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dilbert slides in which a VP of marketing gets punched and spit on elicits general laughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look at the evolution of shipping. By 1960 this industry had reached an apex with the NS Savannah, nuclear-powered cargo ship. Malcolm McLean was a trucker who observed tremendous amounts of delay in transferring merchandise: unloading and loading to and from ships. In the mid-50s he sold his truck company. He bought a rusty old tanker, the SS Maxton, which he put a flat bed on so he could put rectagular containers. SS's maiden voyage was 50 years ago last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Containerized freight revolutionized shipping. The cost used to be $6 a ton. Containerized freight costs 16 cents a ton. There are today millions of people in Asia who owe their middle-class status to Mr. McLean. He didn't focus on the speed of the ship, he focused on speed of loading and unloading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anyone with a science background should read Kuhn. It explains how some young scientist, generally under 30, invents a new paradigm that nobody believes in at first but is eventually embraced by all. Germ theory, Copernicus, etc. That's science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intuit's mission is "to change lives so profoundly that people cannot imagine going back to the old way".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's the story of how we moved from Quicken to QuickBooks. We had less than half the features and were selling at twice the price of the market leaders. The advertising was terrible. Our first ad, I wrote. It was a catastrophe. Second was an ad firm, which produced probably the worst ad in history. Exposed to a million readers. We got 4 responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's the brilliant launch of QuickBooks in 92. Here's how it happened. In one monthe we got to 70% market share. What explains this? It wasn't the advertising. It was something we discovered along the way. We used to make a home consumer product. We surveyed our users, and 40% said they were using our product "in an office". We surveyed again. Same results. We actually called those people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What we discovered was that most people hate debit/credit accounting. Everyone else who made accounting software had debits and credits. What we did was build the first accounting software without debits/credits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QuickBooks revenue growth over 13 years looks great. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;(note: QuickBooks services grow a lot towards the end.) &lt;/span&gt;Here are some of the teams who were responsible for this &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;(shows pictures)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Success starts with humility. "Empathy is not just about walking in anothr's shoes... first you must remove your own shoes." (There's a variant of that quote, "Never criticize a man till you've walked a mile in his shoes. That way, when you criticize him, you're a mile away and you have his shoes.")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What business operates in over 100 countries, has grown 10,000% since 1970, serves 500 million people, volume &amp;gt; $1 trillion annually? Dee Hock's VISA. Hock says, "The problem is never how to get new, innovative thoughts into your mind, but how to get old ones out. Every mind is a room packed with archaic furniture."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Get face-to-face with your customers. In their office, in their home. Find out what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Intuit process is: (1) Involve UX, (2) Find the Customer Problem, (3) Define the requirement, (4) Build. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IRS mails 8 billion pages of tax forms and instructions each year. They could circle the globe 28 times. Americans spend &amp;gt; $200 billion, more hours than it takes to make every car and truck in the US, on taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When you look at market share, we look good, but compared to manual, there's still a lot of people doing it by hand or not using software. We identified 5 taxpayer types and found that TurboTax had 2 of them well covered. The "Worry warts", who want to do their own taxes together with a tax preparer, have different needs. Our design for TurboTax Personal Pro was to "put an expert in the box". You can get into live conversations with experts while doing your taxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Look at the fancy underwear business. Victoria's Secret's share was flat at just over 20%. They went to the customers' houses, combed through their underwear drawers. On the vast majority of occasions, women didn't wear their product. Discovery: sexy underwear isn't thought of as comfortable. This led to Body by Victoria, seamless underwear. This has been huge, it is not the best-selling product line - their share doubled to 45%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Follow the customers while they work. All of us at Intuit do this. Executives do this. We post pictures and reports in the office when we come back. Drucker's Seven Sources of Innovation: the most reliable is The Unexpected. That's what you see when you follow the customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raid had perfected a slow-action formula. The idea was to leave a slight trail, that bugs would get some on themselves and it would not kill them instantly, so they could make it back to the nest and kill the other bugs. They observed that users would not leave a slight trail to the nest: they would drown the one bug in front of them before it could make it back to the nest. So they diluted in a lot of water so it was hard to kill the bug and so the stench wasn't overpowering. Sales up 50%, in an old, established market. And the bugs now survive the flood and can bring the product back to bring down the nest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QuickBooks Point of Sale. We didn't think it could work. Users needed to get too much hardware. Despite my resistance, we made a version with hardware. The version with the hardware is twice the price of the other, but it's selling twice more than the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The best we can hope to bat is .500. If you're getting better than that, you're not swinging for the fences. Even Barry bonds, steroids or not, is not getting that. We need to celebrate failure. Failures are shitty but they let us learn. Here is me hugging the guy who won the Greatest Failure award. There was a learning from what he did. His failed effort produced the learning that young users don't care about taxes, but they do care about the refund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What happens when you have a battle between financial metrics and customer metrics? Typically the customer metric gets blown off. You need a solid customer metric. Andy Taylor, Enterprise Rent-a-Car: "The only way to grow your business is to get your customers to recommend to a friend." Ask your customers if they would recommend you to a friend. 9's and 10's are promoters. Get your business a Net promoter score. There is a clear relation to 3 or 5-year revenue growth. The winners actually get back to detractors, the people who rate them in the bottom half of the scale ("would not recommend").&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among our smallest customers, QuickBooks didn't really deliver what they needed. So we looked at tiny businesses. They needed something simpler. In our Simple Start, "Accounts Receivable" came to be called "Money In", etc. Simple Start is successful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1. Invention comes from mindset change. &lt;br&gt;2. Mindset change comes from seeing differently.&lt;br&gt;3. Savor surprises... as learnings.&lt;br&gt;4. Focus managers on a customer metric.&lt;br&gt;5. Nurture and protect invention teams. Optimize for these teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is another taxpayer type, who likes it simple. Here's the simplest tax form. This one line, requires you to go into th 50-page guide, and you need this page, this one, this one and this one. This is not easy. Only the IRS would call it easy. Here is one prototype they called Taxtasy. It became SnapTax. That idea was invented by a QA person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The boundaries between disciplines blur, and that's how things work best"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teams without barriers. There are cases where you want to prevent management from interfering. Questions can kill an entrepreneurial team. There's only a few questions from management that are actually worth asking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Here's Dan Robinson, an engineer on the Quicken team. His child was born with medical problems. Our medical insurance paid, so cash was not the problem. But the paperwork was amazingly complex. Dan decided this was a real problem we needed to work on. I didn't think we could do it. Others didn't either. But Dan got green lights because he kept answering the questions. The result is the Quicken Medical Expense Manager. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;(shows user interview excerpt)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Questions and answers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. Skills? A. We need people who care, and have curiosity. The best people are those who say "I don't want to see the requirements, I want to see the customers" and will stand for what they know is right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. Usability testing? A. in 1994 we hired the Palo Alto Junior Leaders to do usability testing. The users were totally stumped by what we thought was obvious. No matter how easy the design team believes it is... Simplicity sells. Our real insight was how something that was so obvious for us was so hard for customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. Basic academic research? A. I think so much invention is needed, especially in an interdisciplinary area like this. I think our eyes will open through research, and the companies will then figure out how to answer the needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. Governments? A. The idea of having the government actually watch how citizens operate would be so eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. I work at a small place. How to change the culture from the bottom when the top level doesn't get it? A. A lot of great things happen through guerilla efforts. I think you don't need your boss's approval to talk to customers. this is not expensive stuff. If the company really gets in your way, you may have to go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Q. Do you agree that short-to-medium-term innovation can be customer-driven, but not long-term? Can you go too far in customer focus? A. I think you can't go too far in customer focus, but you can have wrong directions. Some orgs are addicted to surveys, but surveys actually reflect your current mindset. The best insights don't come from quantitative data. As regards the long-term. I agree that customers do not foresee the future. Use the consumer to understand the problem that you are solving. Then it's your job to build it. Of course consumers would never have asked for computers in their homes. Do you remember typewriters, when you made a mistake, it was hell? This was clearly a problem, one that computers can solve really well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. International? A. Automobiles in Japan are used so differently than they are here. In Japan you can have one car for a family of 5 drivers. Nissan sent researchers directly to see families. They got into trouble when an American family figured that the Japanese student they were hosting was actually studying them! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;Tag: &lt;a href="http://technorati.com/tag/chi2006" rel="tag"&gt;&lt;var&gt;chi2006&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;</summary>

Since then, I've built half-a-dozen computers and have bought parts for several others from them, without any problems. They are almost always cheaper than anyone else, with the exception of extraordinarily large or small items which run more expensive due to shipping costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A couple years ago, a motherboard I got from them quit working. I used their on-line return form, and within an hour I received an email stating that they no longer carried the same part, and offered to replace it with a later model motherboard from the same manufacturer, or pay me back the purchase price. I chose the former, and had my replacement within the week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the unique features of this site is the review system: unlike most .com stores, a large percentage of the products sold have multiple reviews by customers, and if an item is consistently rated poorly, it is removed from sale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The site's organization also stands out: items can be separated by features, brand, and price in any combination, using either the "power search," enabling a wide variety of options at once, or by "drilling down" through several searches, isolating items by category.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="newegg2.png" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/newegg2.png" width="200" height="227" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the way, NewEgg sells lots of tech gear, not just computers. For instance the Lumix TZ1 featured &lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001340.php"&gt;recently in Cool Tools&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16830134049"&gt;available from Newegg&lt;/a&gt; for $45 less than the price quoted by Amazon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- Edwin M&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com/"&gt;NewEgg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=FCpxV8lc"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=FCpxV8lc" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=CVIJw2xb"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=CVIJw2xb" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=pOhhwyxX"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=pOhhwyxX" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

      <title>Jump-N-Carry</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jump_carry_sm.jpg" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/jump_carry_sm.jpg" width="216" height="244" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mechanics here in Boston call this a "jump kit." It's a briefcase-sized, 20lb, 12V battery with built-in 12v/120v charger, and with built-in jumper cables attached. The Jump-N-Carry is a much easier way to jump a car; no jockeying the live car to kiss bumpers, no stretching jumper cables between cars. I tend to keep mine in my car, so it's quick &amp; easy to help anyone who needs a jump. A cute trick for a dead alternator is to hook up the jump kit, lay it inside the engine well, close the hood as well as you can, and drive to the shop. One of my mechanics has a J&amp;C with a case that melted from doing this trick, but it still works fine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This model can be charged from your car's cigarette lighter, but I just plug mine into a wall outlet with any extension cord that's handy. It holds its charge for months without recharging. I've had one, trouble-free, for a year and a half.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- Don Davis&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jump-N-Carry&lt;br /&gt; $85&lt;br /&gt; Available from &lt;a href="http://www.nationaltoolwarehouse.com/xq/asp/prodid.19593/TID./qx/product.htm"&gt;National Tool Warehouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=uWwQwdgz"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=uWwQwdgz" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=l0uzDxRl"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=l0uzDxRl" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=l0DYzLaz"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=l0DYzLaz" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

It is basically a stick which you use to shove a towel around the floor with. The towels can then go in the wash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nice thing is that is uses very little liquid, so it can be used on laminates with (reasonable) safety. But the massive wave of towel seem to pick up debris quite well, and changing out your towel is far, far faster than with other replaceable head mops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- Sandi West&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cuban Mop&lt;br /&gt; $10&lt;br /&gt; Available from &lt;a href="http://cubanfoodmarket.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=MOPSET"&gt;Cuban Food Market&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=yYBsJxh4"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=yYBsJxh4" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=MI53TJzU"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=MI53TJzU" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=fYgZ1wnL"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=fYgZ1wnL" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

      <title>Surgeon's knot</title>

My boss, who taught me it, called it the "super knot." How to make it: (if you tie your shoes with one loop then wrap another loop around it) - pass the loop through a second time. (bunny ears method) - pass one ear though a second time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've tested this knot for 8 weeks of hiking around in the forests of New Hampshire and it has never come untied. I noticed that Ian's Shoelace Site has some other recommendations for knots, but I cannot vouch for their security. I know that the Surgeon's Shoelace Knot works for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- Sam Johnson&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/surgeonknot.htm"&gt;Ian's Shoelace Site&lt;/a&gt; for pictures and a clear explanation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=PxULUDDf"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=PxULUDDf" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=aiBcAZIL"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=aiBcAZIL" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=KEDoRV43"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=KEDoRV43" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

      <title>Google Hacks</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Who knew that Google needed a manual? Google's simple interface covers an immensely sophisticated tool that does all kinds of tricks, many of which have little to do with searching and much to do with harnessing the collective power of the web. As a non-programmer I probably won't use many of those hacks. But simply by enhancing my ability to google, this guide -- now in a meaty third edition -- is worth the price. It's the Missing Manual to Google.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- KK&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="googlehacks3_sm.jpg" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/googlehacks3_sm.jpg" width="100" height="150" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google Hacks, 3rd edition&lt;br /&gt; Rael Dornfest, Paul Bausch and Tara Calishain&lt;br /&gt; 2006, 543 pages&lt;br /&gt; From &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596527063/ref=nosim/kkorg-20"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=e2sPwKAe"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=e2sPwKAe" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=cMGZenEA"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=cMGZenEA" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=mfro50KQ"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=mfro50KQ" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

These mapped and designated routes offer travelers researched paths with plenty of information on nearest bike shops, profiles of difficulty, and indicated sleeping possibilities. It all started with Bikecentennial's 1976 TransAm route, the first to cross the continental US, connecting Oregon and Virginia. Thousands still use this route, now overseen by the non-profit Adventure Cycling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I once rode a bike across America using my own route (more adventure) but I have followed long sections of other Adventure Cycling routes. Their materials are well-worth the price; you will however have lots of companions -- which many enjoy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adventure Cycling puts out a pretty good magazine for bicycle long-distance touring (a place to solicit travel companions), runs bike tours, has a decent catalog of touring paraphernalia, and continually pioneers new routes. The newest: the world's longest mountain bike trail, runs 2,500 miles along the Continental Divide from Canada to Mexico. For that kind of amazingly rugged off-the-road trip (which only a few have completed in full), their maps (waterproof) and guides are essential.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- KK&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adventurecycling.org/"&gt;Adventure Cycling Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 800-721-8719&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adventure Cyclist Magazine&lt;br /&gt; 9 issues &lt;br /&gt; included in $30 membership to Adventure Cycling Association&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cyclosource&lt;br /&gt; Maps, Books, and Gear for the Adventure Cyclist&lt;br /&gt; $2 catalog&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=3MRAPc2M"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=3MRAPc2M" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=sXOlCnVw"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=sXOlCnVw" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=j1AX2m1k"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=j1AX2m1k" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

      <title>Anderson Powerpoles</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="powerpoles_sm.jpg" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/powerpoles_sm.jpg" width="160" height="126" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have been building small portable solar systems for camping and power outages using 12 volts. You can run regular 110-volt devices by sending the 12 volts through an inverter, or more efficiently, there are some really great 12-volt products out there. Unfortunately, most of the 12-volt devices you can buy come with a cigarette lighter plug. These plugs are often of poor quality, and are much too bulky, especially when you want to hook up multiple things to a power source.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I went searching for a better connecting system, and it turns out the ham radio crowd found a great solution years ago. They are called Anderson Powerpoles, and are perhaps the perfect 12-volt connector. Some of the advantages:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;* Flat wiping contact system (cleans the contacts every time you use them)&lt;br /&gt; * Interchangeable genderless design&lt;br /&gt; * Colored, modular housings&lt;br /&gt; * Polarized, so you can't hook things up wrong way&lt;br /&gt; * 15/30/45 amp contacts use the same housing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I chopped off every cigarette lighter plug I have, and now put these on everything. Of course I still keep one lighter plug around (with a powerpole on the other end) for when I need juice from a car.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- Howie Oakes&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anderson Powerpoles&lt;br /&gt; $1 per set&lt;br /&gt; Available from &lt;a href="http://www.powerwerx.com/category.asp?CtgID=1001"&gt;PowerWerx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~buck0/app.htm"&gt;More info&lt;/a&gt; and ideas about Powerpoles&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=hijjQA0j"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=hijjQA0j" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=T75wWh1f"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=T75wWh1f" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=LFgOS4OW"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=LFgOS4OW" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

      <title>PowerGrips</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="power_grips_sm.jpg" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/power_grips_sm.jpg" width="250" height="248" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PowerGrips give most of the benefits of toeclips or clipless/cleat systems on bicycle pedals, without most of the downsides. The concept is simple: an asymmetrical strap of cloth that attaches securely to most bicycle platform pedals. The strap is attached in such a way that it loosens when you rotate your heel away from the bike, and tightens when you "heel-in". This gives you similar benefits of a clipless/cleat system; greater efficiency in pedalling, because you can pull on the pedals' upstrokes, rather than just being able to push down. They are just as easy (if not easier) to disengage from. The PowerGrips also have a couple of other benefits which fit well with all but the higher-end performance cyclists:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;* Can be used with regular shoes or sandals. Almost no lock-in to a particular type of clip/cleat system.&lt;br /&gt; * (Relatively) cheap, at only $20-$25.&lt;br /&gt; * You can get off the bike and walk around without looking like you're doing some sort of odd balancing act, or scratching up whatever floor you're walking on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because the PowerGrip strap is directly above the pedal, gravity does tend to flip it upside-down when not in use. Just as with toe-clips I can pedal on the upside-down pedal to get started, then flip it over with my foot when I'm moving and insert my foot into the strap. Since my riding is commuting to/from work, I have a fair amount of stop-go traffic at intersections, and feel less likely to get a foot stuck and fall over sideways when I have to stop. The PowerGrip strap is totally loose enough for me to quickly get my foot out at a stop, and it has the unusual benefit of being as tight as I want it to be (without using my hands), depending on how I adjust the strap, and how far I heel-in to the pedal. So the "float" can be adjusted on the fly, according to my current riding conditions. This takes a little getting used to, but in my opinion, involves a lower learning curve than clipless pedals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- Brian&lt;br /&gt; PowerGrips&lt;br /&gt; $17&lt;br /&gt; Available from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000HGBEXY/ref=nosim/kkorg-20"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manufactured by &lt;a href="http://www.powergrips.com/"&gt;PowerGrips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=A7pjBhbG"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=A7pjBhbG" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=2dR5nOoj"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=2dR5nOoj" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=kykbicR3"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=kykbicR3" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

We needed a way to get debris out of the house and into the dumpster parked on the street. Since we preferred to not carry buckets of plaster through our house, we needed an alternative. I found a link online and thought I would give Demo Bags a try. We sealed ourselves into the bathroom, filled the bags, and duct taped them shut. Then we threw them out the second floor window and dragged them to the dumpster. Not one of the 40 that we filled broke open. For a small remodel these are ideal! Our only mistake was to make them too heavy. Do yourself a favor: buy a lot of 'em, and make them light!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- Matthew L.

I've also used mine for erecting and tightening large tents and canopies, pulling objects into and onto trucks, hoisting 350 lb carcasses for butchering, encouraging crunched automobile bodies back into proper shape, pulling stumps, straightening sagging barns back to verticality, moving large logs, turning trailers to face another direction, erecting pre-assembled 2x4 wall sections built on the floor, cinching loads onto flatbed trucks, dragging heavy boats up the ramp onto the dock or onto their trailers, erecting wind generators, extracting and installing engines in vehicles and boats. In other words, moving just about anything up to 2 tons. Come-alongs should not be used to move people, since a well-used cable can snap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Maasdam Pow'r Pull is the best (though not the cheapest) come-along you can buy. It is built better than knock-off copies -- especially the $19.95 ones -- in every way. There's an accessory wire gripper that enables the Maasdam (or any other pull tool) to tighten fences, clotheslines etc. I've beat the hell out of my 1969-model, and it has never failed. It will pull 2 tons. You can buy very expensive aluminum giant come-alongs from several firms, but the fine print with them sez that they are also 2-ton, so I don't see much point in them except they are beautiful and classy-looking. Any tool that carries a high loading should be of the very best quality, as failure can be deadly or at the least scary. The Maasdam is good stuff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hints for working with a come-along: Many folks loop a come-along's cable hook around an object and then hook it back onto the cable like a noose. This is very unsafe, as the hook will either cut or seriously damage the cable. Users should invest in a couple of suitable "Shackles" (any hardware or boat store) for such duty, and never hook anything directly to a come-along's cable. Hint for come-along use where there are no trees or objects to anchor it to: Bury your spare tire a couple feet down and hook to that. Come-alongs also need some sort of anchor for the mechanism. I keep a length of 3/8ths chain for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- J.

      <title>Lumix TZ1</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lumix.jpg" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/lumix.jpg" width="187" height="124" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The previous Lumix digital camera I raved about &lt;a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/001055.php"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; is no longer being manufactured, so this improved Lumix digital camera is the one I now use and recommend. At least for the next few months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main advantage the Lumix has over other ever-better digital cameras is their high powered optical ultra zooms. This one has a 10X zoom, which gives it telephoto capabilities in a camera that can hide in my shirt or pants pocket. It is the equivalent of having a 35mm - 350 mm zoom lens for free! It performs this magic using a clever prism system inside. And like the previous Lumixes it applies very capable image stabilization to pictures so they are very sharp even in low light. It sports a fast Leica lens for additional ease in taking pictures anywhere without flash (my preference). I am furthered endeared to this new model because it has instant power-up. Its screen is on and ready to shoot the moment I turn it on. The rest of the features are now pretty standard in digital point-and-shoots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This small camera fits in the palm of my hand and does just about everything my old 35mm Nikons with five heavy lenses did, much faster and better. (I carried two SLR bodies and five lenses around every day all day for almost 8 years.) I also prefer it to the high end digital SRL Nikons and Canons now popular with pros. The Lumix TZ1 does not capture RAW files, but most non-professionals won't need that. While it does macro closeups well, it could really use a wide-angle option, but that's the only thing I miss.&lt;br /&gt; Compared to $1,000 for a digital SLR, this baby is about $320. I carry mine everywhere with me in my jacket or pants, and the quality of my images is better than what I got from my 35mm Nikons because I can shoot in lower light, further, with less blur. I would have died for this miniature high quality camera when I was shooting every day in Asia decades ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I should also mention that with a 1 gig memory card in it, it can capture up to 20 minutes of okay (848 x 480) video -- with zoom!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ1 is the best general purpose digital camera to get at the moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- KK&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ1&lt;br /&gt; $340&lt;br /&gt; Available from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000EITTLE/ref=nosim/kkorg-20"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manufactured by &lt;a href="http://www.panasonic.com/consumer_electronics/digital_cameras/lumix.asp"&gt;Panasonic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=qMMWwK3T"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=qMMWwK3T" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=cRAKAqLB"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=cRAKAqLB" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=0jGJnpBz"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=0jGJnpBz" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

      <title>Solution Wanted</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;I have a number of jobs to do on the roof of my house. In my younger years I had no trouble working high, and even spent time caving and some rock climbing. However when I hit sixty my comfort level working high vanished, and now I am quite insecure over a few feet above ground. Roofing was not one of my many earlier stints, so I really do not know where to begin in setting up a securing system for working safely at height. Surely there must be some easy-to-use "cool tool" for people working high. If anyone can help me with a recommendation on this, I would appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- Mike Saunders&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=eKcpELKr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=eKcpELKr" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=gU7vHAq8"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=gU7vHAq8" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=PzTwj8pc"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=PzTwj8pc" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

In other words, it lights up near a "live" wire. You don't actually have to make contact to see if the line is hot. It lights up even if there is no load on the line, since it senses the electric field, not the magnetic field. It's much easier to use than a contact indicator light or meter. It works for AC line voltages. Also it only lights up when near the "hot" line, not the ground or neutral, so you can immediately see if an outlet is wired backwards. Works great for finding the dead Christmas light bulb on a series string of lights too (not as easy though when you have two or more strands braided together.) I always rub it against my shirt first to see if it is working. Static discharge sets it off. A number of vendors besides Fluke make this type of device, but Fluke is a high quality name brand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- Bruce Bowen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fluke Voltalert&lt;br /&gt; 90VAC to 600 VAC&lt;br /&gt; $24&lt;br /&gt; Available from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001X0QFK/ref=nosim/kkorg-20"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manufactured by &lt;a href="http://us.fluke.com/usen/products/Fluke+1ACII+VoltAlert.htm?catalog_name=FlukeUnitedStates&amp;Category=ELT(FlukeProducts)"&gt;Fluke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=bsLkfHLB"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=bsLkfHLB" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=W6r96FMV"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=W6r96FMV" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=wjzc4xgP"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=wjzc4xgP" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

      <title>Sandcastles Made Simple</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sandcastles1.png" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/sandcastles1.png" width="212" height="220" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In case you haven't noticed, sand castles have become very elaborate and sand sculpture a new art form. Building them is a complicated business. We've used the simple methods here to build sandcastles we can be proud of without too much equipment. In our experience the most important part is finding a beach with suitable building sand. For the rest, follow this book and/or DVD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- KK&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most beach trips I would sit and read while my wife played around in the sand building castles. This year, I found a great resource that had me building sand castles and sculptures that stopped every passerby on the beach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Sons of the Beach Sandcastles Made Simple book showed me how to build high-reaching towers and arches by hand, without any buckets or forms. Their tool set was perfect for giving professional looking details. Their optional DVD makes it even easier to learn their technique.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first week I had their book, I built a 48" tall light house, several castles (one with a monorail train), and a snowman (they teach you how to make snowballs out of sand). Many people asked me how many years I'd been doing sand sculpture!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book and DVD teach "hand stacking." This is a process of scooping a big handfuls of completely saturated wet sand and plopping them on top of each other. By jiggling the sand just as the excess water is running out, it fuses the new plop with the previous ones creating a stable tower.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sandcastles2.png" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/sandcastles2.png" width="336" height="279" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tools for advanced sand castling&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These folks also discuss and sell large forms (5, 3, 2 foot diameter) which can be used for large competition sculpture, but that was more than I wanted to carry down to the beach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- Chris Evans&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sandcastles3.png" src="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/sandcastles3.png" width="131" height="150" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sandcastles Made Simple&lt;br /&gt; Lucinda Wierenga&lt;br /&gt; 2005, 128 pages&lt;br /&gt; $12&lt;br /&gt; Available from &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1584794089/ref=nosim/kkorg-20"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sobshop.com/tools/index.html"&gt;Author website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=yDBiUtZM"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=yDBiUtZM" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=DBRm5chu"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=DBRm5chu" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?a=kjkHRhZ2"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/CoolTools?i=kjkHRhZ2" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</summary>

      <title>WPF Animation</title>
      <id>http://software.ericsink.com/entries/WPF_Animation.html</id>

      <published>Wed, 02 Aug 2006 10:21:02 CST</published>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;So when my woodworking app displays a join (two pieces of wood being glued or fastened together), I figured it would be nice to animate the display to make it easier to see how the join is done.&amp;nbsp; And since WPF is supposed to have cool animation features, why not try it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until now, my experience with WPF has been so productive as to be surreal.&amp;nbsp; With no prior experience, I can often get something new working with WPF in the amount of time it takes for my daughters to watch an episode of Sponge Bob.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, animation wasn't quite that simple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Frames&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;My first attempt was unsuccessful because I was going about things the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since I had two objects which I want to move back and forth, I figured I would just create ten frames by moving the objects apart a little bit further on each frame.&amp;nbsp; The moving of the objects was done using a simple 3D translation in my solid modeler.&amp;nbsp; Each time I moved the objects, I converted my solid model into a triangle mesh suitable for display.&amp;nbsp; The result is that I would end up with ten meshes, one for each frame.&amp;nbsp; Showing the animation would be a simple matter of showing each mesh in succession.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I wrote the code to get my solid modeler to produce the ten sets of triangles, but things got difficult when I tried hooking this up to WPF's animation stuff.&amp;nbsp; Life would have been simpler if I had looked at the WPF animation samples or documentation first.&amp;nbsp; I assumed WPF would let me register a delegate or something which would get called when it's time to flip to the next frame. &amp;nbsp;In that callback, I would switch my viewport3d to the next mesh.&amp;nbsp; But that's not how WPF animation works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The WPF animation stuff wants to tweak a property of an object.&amp;nbsp; You tell it which object and which property.&amp;nbsp; You provide it a range of values for that property and specify the amount of time it should take to get from the beginning to the end.&amp;nbsp; For example, you might say "cycle the Angle property from 0 to 360 over a 7 second interval".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The absence of the notion of frames is a feature, not a bug.&amp;nbsp; Somewhere deep in the bowels of System.Windows.Media.Animation there is some code which is making smart decisions about how many frames to use depending on how fast my hardware is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, this design certainly suggests that the property to be animated needs to be numeric, like a double or an int.&amp;nbsp; If I'm allowed to pass in a collection of mesh objects, I don't see how.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tried to create a wrapper class with a FrameNumber property so I could just use an Int32Animation to flip through the frames by number.&amp;nbsp; But at this point it really seemed like I was swimming upstream.&amp;nbsp; So I decided to step back and rethink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Transforms&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;WPF 3D has a really nice habit of using matrix transform objects all over the place.&amp;nbsp; Model3DGroup has a Transform object.&amp;nbsp; So does GeometryModel3D.&amp;nbsp; The cameras and lights have one too.&amp;nbsp; These things make it easier to scale, rotate and translate things without changing the actual geometry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And they were designed to be animated.&amp;nbsp; So...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;I tossed out the code to generate 10 different meshes for 10 frames and wrote code to generate two meshes.&amp;nbsp; One set of triangles was for the part of my solid model that is moving, and the other set corresponds to the part that is to remain in place.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Then I created a TranslateTransform3D object as a hookup point for animation.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Then I took the moving triangles and stuffed them in a GeometryModel3D object and set the Transform to point to the TranslateTransform3D instance I just created.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Then I created a DoubleAnimation object to animate the TranslateTransform3D object.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sweet.&amp;nbsp; Everything worked perfectly, except for one silly hack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Only One Property&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only problem here is that I don't like the way TranslateTransform3D works.&amp;nbsp; It has three properties:&amp;nbsp; OffsetX, OffsetY, and OffsetZ.&amp;nbsp; Since I happened to be animating something moving parallel to an axis, this was not really a problem.&amp;nbsp; But what if I wanted to be moving something in a straight line where X, Y and Z were all changing by different amounts?&amp;nbsp; I suppose I could create three separate DoubleAnimation objects, but that feels like a silly hack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I really want is a different translation class.&amp;nbsp; Instead of three separate offsets for X, Y and Z, what I want is a unit vector and scaling factor.&amp;nbsp; The unit vector determines the direction.&amp;nbsp; The scaling factor determines how far in that direction to translate.&amp;nbsp; Then I could hook up a DoubleAnimation object to the scaling factor property.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I decided to just create the class I need.&amp;nbsp; All I have to do is subclass TranslateTransform3D and provide two new properties to do what I want.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oops!&amp;nbsp; That class is sealed.&amp;nbsp; I wonder why?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh well, I guess I can just move up a level and subclass from AffineTransform3D.&amp;nbsp; It'll be a little more work, but I'll live.&amp;nbsp; So:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"; color:blue'&gt;&amp;nbsp; public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;VectorTranslateTransform3D&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;AffineTransform3D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ouch!&amp;nbsp; The compiler says I have to implement CreateInstanceCore, AddRefOnChannelCore, ReleaseOnChannelCore and GetHandleCore.&amp;nbsp; What the heck is all this stuff?&amp;nbsp; The documentation is silent.&amp;nbsp; I Googled &amp;quot;AddRefOnChannelCore" and found &lt;a href="http://www.ureader.com/message/884678.aspx"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by somebody at Microsoft named Adam Smith who explains that subclassing from these classes is a bad idea.&amp;nbsp; Bummer.&amp;nbsp; I guess I'm stuck with my silly hack for now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(If anybody in Redmond is reading this, please accept my vote for VectorTranslateTransform3D, with two properties:&amp;nbsp; a Direction vector and a Distance double.&amp;nbsp; Thanks!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Wait -- One Last Try&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After giving up on the idea of having my animation work on one property instead of three, I couldn't sleep.&amp;nbsp; So I decided to try one last thing:&amp;nbsp; If inheritance won't work, maybe encapsulation will.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Success!&amp;nbsp; Here's the code for my VectorTranslateTransform3D class:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt; font-family:"Courier New"'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; This class encapsulates a TranslateTransform3D object but&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; presents a different interface.&amp;nbsp; Instead of x, y, and z&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; offsets, we use a unit vector and a scaling factor.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; This class was created specifically to allow a DoubleAnimation&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; to use the Distance property as a target.&amp;nbsp; For that reason,&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; Distance is a DependencyProperty.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; Intuitively, this class should derive from DependencyObject,&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; but when I do this, the code compiles but the animation&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; doesn't work.&amp;nbsp; If I instead just change the base class&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; to UIElement, it works.&amp;nbsp; I'm not yet sure why.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;///&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:green'&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='color:gray'&gt;&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I still wish a vector-based translation class was built in to the framework.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Name Weirdness&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another "problem" is that the WPF animation stuff is a bit awkward to use from C#.&amp;nbsp; It appears to be designed to be used from XAML.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I already said that the animation objects require me to specify an object and a property on that object.&amp;nbsp; I was kind of assuming this would be simple, like maybe just passing the object into the constructor of the animation object and giving the name of the property as a string.&amp;nbsp; Instead, I had to fiddle around with classes called NameScope, DependencyProperty and PropertyPath, and I'm still not sure I understand any of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So first I create my translation object:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt; font-family:"Courier New";color:teal'&gt;&amp;nbsp; TranslateTransform3D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'&gt; ttmove = &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;TranslateTransform3D&lt;/span&gt;(0, 0, 0);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And a reference to this object is placed inside all the GeometryModel3D objects which need to move around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then I create my encapsulation object:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt; font-family:"Courier New"'&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;VectorTranslateTransform3D&lt;/span&gt; vtt = &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;VectorTranslateTransform3D&lt;/span&gt;(ttmove, &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;Vector3D&lt;/span&gt;(vec.x, vec.y, vec.z), 0);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then I create a NameScope in my current window and register the translation object with a name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt; font-family:"Courier New";color:teal'&gt;&amp;nbsp; NameScope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size: 10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'&gt;.SetNameScope(&lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;NameScope&lt;/span&gt;());&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;&amp;nbsp; this&lt;/span&gt;.RegisterName(&lt;span style='color:maroon'&gt;&amp;quot;whyistherumalwaysgone&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;, vtt);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then when I create my Storyboard and DoubleAnimation objects, I need to hook them up through the namescope thingie:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt; font-family:"Courier New";color:teal'&gt;&amp;nbsp; DoubleAnimation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'&gt; ia = &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;DoubleAnimation&lt;/span&gt;(blah blah blah);&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;&amp;nbsp; Storyboard&lt;/span&gt;.SetTargetName(ia, &lt;span style='color:maroon'&gt;&amp;quot;whyistherumalwaysgone&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And to specify which property is being manipulated for the animation, I have to do this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt; font-family:"Courier New";color:teal'&gt;&amp;nbsp; Storyboard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'&gt;.SetTargetProperty(ia, &lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;PropertyPath&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;VectorTranslateTransform3D&lt;/span&gt;.DistanceProperty)));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this code feels a bit dorky, but I understand why it's there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, the results are beautiful.&amp;nbsp; I'm not going to publish an xbap demo since everybody had trouble getting &lt;a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/WPF_Apache_Linux.html"&gt;the last one&lt;/a&gt; to work, presumably because I'm still on WPF beta 2.&amp;nbsp; All this stuff will be easier when WPF is actually a shipping technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But suffice it to say that the animation works very well.&amp;nbsp; It's very smooth, with no flicker.&amp;nbsp; The CPU usage graph stays at zero while the animation is running.&amp;nbsp; Using the mouse to rotate and zoom works perfectly even while the animation is going on.&amp;nbsp; I can even print the Viewport3D while the animation is running, with the resulting page showing whatever was on the screen when I clicked the print button.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <summary>&lt;P&gt;This is part of an online book called &lt;a href="http://software.ericsink.com/scm/source_control.html"&gt;Source Control HOWTO&lt;/a&gt;, a best practices guide on source control, version control, and configuration management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table border=0 width="100%"&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align="left"&gt;&lt;a href="http://software.ericsink.com/scm/scm_merge_branches.html"&gt;&amp;lt; Chapter 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td align="right"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Background:&amp;nbsp; What is an IDE?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The various applications used by software developers are traditionally called "tools".&amp;nbsp; When we speak of "developer tools", we're talking about the essential items that programmers use every day, like compilers and text editors and syntax checkers and Mountain Dew.&amp;nbsp; Just as a master carpenter uses her tools to build a house, developers use their tools to build software applications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the old days, each developer would assemble their own collection of their favorite tools.&amp;nbsp; Back around 1991, my preferred toolset looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;gcc (for compiling source code)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;gdb (for debugging)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;make (for managing builds)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;rcs (for managing versions)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;emacs (for editing source code)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;vi (for editing the emacs makefile)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fifteen years later, most developers would consider this approach to be strange.&amp;nbsp; Today, everything is "integrated".&amp;nbsp; Instead of selecting one of each kind of tool, we select an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), an application which collects all the necessary tools together in one place.&amp;nbsp; To continue the metaphor, we would say that the focus today is not on the individual tools, but rather, on the workshop in which those tools are used.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This trend is hardly new.&amp;nbsp; Ever since Borland released &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal"&gt;Turbo Pascal&lt;/a&gt; in 1983, IDEs have become more popular every year.&amp;nbsp; In the last ten years, many IDE products have disappeared as the industry has consolidated.&amp;nbsp; Today, it is only a small exaggeration to say that there are just two IDEs left:&amp;nbsp; Visual Studio and Eclipse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But despite the industry consolidation, the trend is clear.&amp;nbsp; Developers want their tools to be &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; well integrated together.&amp;nbsp; Most recently, Microsoft's &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/default.aspx"&gt;Visual Studio Team System&lt;/a&gt; takes this trend to a higher level than we have previously seen.&amp;nbsp; Mainstream IDEs in the past have provided base operations such as editing, compiling, building and documentation.&amp;nbsp; Now Visual Studio also has unit tests, visual modeling, code generators, and work item tracking.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, the IDE isn't just for coders anymore.&amp;nbsp; Every task performed by every person involved in the software development process is moving into the IDE.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Benefits of source control integration with IDEs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Source control is one of the development tools which has been commonly integrated into IDEs for quite some time.&amp;nbsp; The fit is very natural.&amp;nbsp; Here at SourceGear, our source control product has two main client applications:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1&gt; &lt;li &gt;A standalone client application which is specifically designed to talk with the source control server.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;A client plugin which adds source control features into Visual Studio.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the IDE client is very popular with our users.&amp;nbsp; Many of our users would never think about using source control without IDE integration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why does version control work so nicely inside an IDE?&amp;nbsp; Because it makes the three most common operations a lot easier:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;Checkout&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;When using the checkout-edit-checkin model, files must be checked out before they are edited.&amp;nbsp; With source control integrated into an IDE, this task can be quite automatic.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, when you begin to edit a file, the IDE will notice that you do not have it checked out yet and check the file out for you.&amp;nbsp; Effectively, this means developers never need to remember to checkout a file.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;Add&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;A common and frustrating mistake is to add a new file to a project but forget to place it under source control.&amp;nbsp; So when I am done with my coding task, I checkin my changes to the existing files, but the newly added file never makes it into the repository.&amp;nbsp; The build is broken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;When using source control integration with an IDE, this mistake is basically impossible to make.&amp;nbsp; Most IDEs today support the notion of a "project", a list of all files which are considered part of the build process.&amp;nbsp; When used with source control, the IDE decides what files to place under source control because it knows every file that is part of the project.&amp;nbsp; The act of adding a file to the project also adds it to source control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;Checkin&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;IDEs excel at nagging developers.&amp;nbsp; The user interface of an IDE has special places to nag the developer about compiler errors and unsaved files and even unfixed bugs.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, visual indicators in the IDE can be used to remind the developer that he has not yet checked in his changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When source control is integrated into an IDE, developers don't have to think about it very much.&amp;nbsp; They don't have to try to remember to Checkout, Add or Checkin because the IDE is either performing those actions automatically or reminding them to do it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bigger benefits&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you integrate source control into an IDE, you open the possibility for cool features that go beyond the basics.&amp;nbsp; For example, source control integration can be incredibly helpful when used with refactoring.&amp;nbsp; When I use the refactoring features of Eclipse to rename a Java class, it is obviously nice that Eclipse figures out all the changes that need to be made.&amp;nbsp; It's even nicer that Eclipse automatically handles all the necessary source control operations.&amp;nbsp; It even performs the name change of the source file.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For another example, here is a screen shot of a &lt;a href="http://software.ericsink.com/scm/scm_history.html"&gt;Blame&lt;/a&gt; feature integrated into Eclipse:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://software.ericsink.com/scm/screendumps/scm_eclipse_blame.png"&gt;&lt;img border=0 width=576 height=395 src="http://software.ericsink.com/scm/screendumps/scm_eclipse_blame.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The user story for this feature goes like this:&amp;nbsp; The developer is coding and she encounters something that deserves to be on &lt;a href="http://thedailywtf.com/"&gt;The Daily WTF&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; She wants to immediately know who is responsible, so she right-clicks on the offensive line and selects the Blame feature.&amp;nbsp; The source control plugin queries the repository for history and determines who made the change.&amp;nbsp; The task was simpler because the Blame feature is conveniently located in the place where it is most likely to be needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tradeoffs and Problems&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For source control, IDE integration is great in theory, but it has not always been so great in practice.&amp;nbsp; The tradeoffs of having your IDE do source control for you are the same as the tradeoffs of having your IDE do anything else.&amp;nbsp; It's easier, but you have less control over the process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before I continue, I need to make a confession:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;I personally have never used source control integration with an IDE.&amp;nbsp; Heck, for a long time I didn't use IDEs at all.&amp;nbsp; I'm a control freak.&amp;nbsp; It's not enough for me to know what's going on under the hood.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes I prefer to just do everything myself.&amp;nbsp; I don't like project-based build systems where I add a few files and the IDE magically builds my app.&amp;nbsp; I like diving make systems where I can control exactly where everything is and where the build targets are placed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;Except for a brief and passionate affair with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THINK_C"&gt;Think C&lt;/a&gt; during the late eighties, I didn't really start using IDE project files until Visual Studio .NET.&amp;nbsp; Today, I am gradually becoming more and more of an IDE user, but I still prefer to do all source control operations using a standalone GUI client.&amp;nbsp; Eventually, that will change, and my transformation to IDE user will be complete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, for the sake of completeness, I will explain the tradeoffs I see with using source control integration with IDEs.&amp;nbsp; This should be taken as information, not as an argument against the feature.&amp;nbsp; IDE integration is the most natural way to use source control on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first observation is that IDE clients have fewer features than standalone clients.&amp;nbsp; The IDE is great for basic source control operations, but it is definitely not the natural place to perform &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; source control operations.&amp;nbsp; Some things, such as branching, don't fit very well at all.&amp;nbsp; However, this is a minor point which merely illustrates that an IDE client cannot be the only user interface for accessing a source control repository.&amp;nbsp; If this were the only problem, it would not be a problem.&amp;nbsp; This is the sort of tradeoff that I would consciously accept.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The real problem with source control integration for IDEs is that it just doesn't work very well.&amp;nbsp; For this sad state of affairs, I put most of the blame on MSSCCI.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;MSSCCI&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's pronounced "misskee", and it stands for Microsoft Source Code Control Interface.&amp;nbsp; MSSCCI is the API which defines the interaction between Microsoft Visual Studio and source control tools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A source control tool which wants to support integration with Visual Studio must implement this API.&amp;nbsp; Basically, it's a DLL which defines a number of documented entry points.&amp;nbsp; When configured properly, the IDE makes calls into the DLL to perform source control operations as needed or as requested by the user.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Originally, Microsoft's developer tools were the only host environments for MSSCCI.&amp;nbsp; Today, MSSCCI is used by lots of other IDEs as well.&amp;nbsp; It has become sort of a de facto standard.&amp;nbsp; Source control vendors implemented MSSCCI plugins so that their products could be used within Microsoft IDEs.&amp;nbsp; In turn, vendors of other IDEs implemented MSSCCI hosting so that their products could be used with the already-available source control plugins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ubiquity of MSSCCI is very unfortunate.&amp;nbsp; MSSCCI was designed to be a bridge between SourceSafe and early versions of Microsoft Visual Studio.&amp;nbsp; It served this purpose just fine, but now the API is being used for lots of other version control tools besides SourceSafe and lots of other IDEs besides Visual Studio.&amp;nbsp; It is being used in ways that it was never designed to be used, resulting in lots of frustration.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The top three problems with MSSCCI are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1&gt; &lt;li &gt;&lt;b&gt;Poor performance&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; SourceSafe has no support for networking, but the architecture of most modern version control tools involves a client and a server with TCP in between.&amp;nbsp; To get excellent performance from a client-server application, careful attention must be paid to the way the networking is done.&amp;nbsp; Things like threading and blocking and buffering are very important.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, MSSCCI makes this rather difficult.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;&lt;b&gt;No Edit-Merge-Commit&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; SourceSafe is basically built around the Checkout-Edit-Checkin approach, so that's how MSSCCI works.&amp;nbsp; Building a satisfactory MSSCCI plugin for the Edit-Merge-Commit paradigm is very difficult.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;&lt;b&gt;No Atomic transactions&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; SourceSafe has no support for atomic transactions, so MSSCCI and Visual Studio were not designed to use them.&amp;nbsp; This means that sometimes modern version control tools like Vault can't group things together properly at commit time.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;On top of all this, all the world's MSSCCI hosts tend to implement their side of the API a little differently.&amp;nbsp; If you implement a MSSCCI plugin and get everything working with Visual Studio 2003, you have approximately zero chance of it working well with Visual Basic 6, FoxPro or Visual Interdev.&amp;nbsp; After you code in all the special hacks to get things compatible with these fringe Microsoft environments, your plugin still has no real chance of working with third party products like &lt;a href="http://www.multiedit.com/"&gt;MultiEdit&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Every IDE requires some different tweaks and quirky behavior to make it work.&amp;nbsp; By the time you get your plugin working with some of these other IDEs, your regression testing shows that it doesn't work with Visual Studio 2003 anymore.&amp;nbsp; Lather.&amp;nbsp; Rinse.&amp;nbsp; Repeat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most developers who work with MSSCCI eventually turn to recreational pharmaceuticals in a futile effort to cope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A brighter future&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Luckily, MSSCCI is fading away.&amp;nbsp; Earlier in this article I flippantly joked that Visual Studio and Eclipse were the only IDEs left in the world.&amp;nbsp; This is of course an exaggeration, but the fact remains that these two products have the lion's share, so we can take some comfort in their dominance when we think about the prevalence of MSSCCI in the future:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;Eclipse does not use MSSCCI.&amp;nbsp; It has its own source control integration APIs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Visual Studio 2005 introduced a new and greatly improved API for source control integration.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, the two dominant IDEs today inspire us to dream of a MSSCCI-free world.&amp;nbsp; The planet will certainly be a nicer place to live when MSSCCI is a distant memory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here at SourceGear, the various problems with MSSCCI have caused us to hold a cautious and reserved stance toward IDE integration.&amp;nbsp; Most of our customers really would prefer an IDE client, so we give them one.&amp;nbsp; But we consider our standalone GUI client to be the primary UI because it is faster and more full-featured.&amp;nbsp; And internally, most of us on the Vault team use the standalone GUI client for our everyday work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But our posture is changing dramatically.&amp;nbsp; We are currently working on an Eclipse plugin as well as a completely new plugin for the new source control API in Visual Studio 2005.&amp;nbsp; Sometime in early 2007, we will be ready to consider our IDE clients to be primary, with our other client applications to be available for less common operations.&amp;nbsp; What do I mean when I say "primary"?&amp;nbsp; Well, among other things, I mean that the IDE clients will be the way we use our own product.&amp;nbsp; Including me.&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;:-)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's not yet terribly impressive to look at, but here's a screen shot of our new Visual Studio 2005 client:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://software.ericsink.com/scm/screendumps/scm_vsip_client.png"&gt;&lt;img border=0 width=576 height=395 src="http://software.ericsink.com/scm/screendumps/scm_vsip_client.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The direction of this industry right now is toward more and more integration.&amp;nbsp; This is a very good thing.&amp;nbsp; We're going to see many new improvements.&amp;nbsp; Users will be happier.&amp;nbsp; Just as a spice rack belongs near the stove, source control should always be available where the developer is working.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;I've been wondering if it's possible to serve a WPF browser application from my Linux box.&amp;nbsp; I found the &lt;a href="http://laurenlavoie.com/avalon/111"&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; on Lauren Lavoie's blog, but I just had to try it for myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I added the following five lines to the appropriate VirtualHost section of my httpd.conf file:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:9.0pt; font-family:"Courier New"'&gt;AddType application/manifest .manifest&lt;br&gt; AddType application/xaml+xml .xaml&lt;br&gt; AddType application/x-ms-application .application&lt;br&gt; AddType application/x-ms-xbap .xbap&lt;br&gt; AddType application/octet-stream .deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then I created a simple WPF browser and copied the resulting files up to my web server.&amp;nbsp; It worked!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href="http://sawdust.com/test/test.xbap"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to try it out.&amp;nbsp; This is being served by Apache from my Linux server.&amp;nbsp; You'll need to have your desktop machine properly configured for running WPF applications.&amp;nbsp; This app was built with beta 2.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;For those who want more details...&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The source code for this simple xbap is &lt;a href="http://sawdust.com/test/ericsink_xbap_src.zip"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Here is how I created it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1&gt; &lt;li &gt;First I told Visual Studio to create a new "WinFX Web Browser Application".&amp;nbsp; (I'm still on beta 2, so I haven't made the name change to .NET 3.0 yet)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Then I made several additions to Page1.xaml&lt;/li&gt; &lt;ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a&gt; &lt;li &gt;I added a label at the top so I would have a place to let the user know that the mouse does something.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;I added a toolbar so I would have a place to add a Print button.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;The ViewPort3D stuff is mostly copied from one of the WPF samples in the Windows SDK.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;The MeshGeometry3D data was the tricky part.&amp;nbsp; I hacked the solid modeling code in my woodworking app to output triangles in XAML and pasted the result in here.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;li &gt;Finally, I made some additions to Page1.cs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a&gt; &lt;li &gt;I added a handler for the Print button.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;I pasted in the trackball code from &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danlehen/default.aspx"&gt;Daniel Lehenbauer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;I added code to create a trackball and hook it up to the camera and the light.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;The last time I worked on an app which used 3D graphics, printing was fairly simple.&amp;nbsp; OpenGL was brand new and DirectX didn't exist yet, so we had to do all the projection math anyway.&amp;nbsp; Adapting the code from screen to paper wasn't a big deal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Modern graphics APIs are great, but they don't help with printing.&amp;nbsp; Since I started my woodworking app using C# and Direct3D, I always figured it would be a huge task to implement printing.&amp;nbsp; More to the point, since this app is a hobby project and the implementation of printing would probably be like real work, I figured this app would &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; be able to print.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recently I switched everything over to WPF.&amp;nbsp; Here is my printing code:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='text-autospace:none'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt; font-family:"Courier New";color:teal'&gt;PrintDialog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style='font-size: 10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'&gt; dlg = &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style='color:teal'&gt;PrintDialog&lt;/span&gt;();&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; ((&lt;span style='color:blue'&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;)dlg.ShowDialog().GetValueOrDefault())&lt;br&gt; {&lt;br&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; dlg.PrintVisual(myViewport, &lt;span style='color:maroon'&gt;&amp;quot;sawdust&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;);&lt;br&gt; }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five lines.&amp;nbsp; Were it not for my pathological need to use braces on every if statement, it would be three lines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, yes I know -- a useful real-world printing feature would require more work.&amp;nbsp; I'm just saying:&amp;nbsp; I added these five lines to my app and a color picture of my bookshelf model emerged out of the printer down the hall.&amp;nbsp; That's excellent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Eric, and I am a coding addict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I founded SourceGear, I was a programmer.&amp;nbsp; Nine years later, my company has turned me into a marketing guy.&amp;nbsp; After all the sacrifices I made to get this company going, it has coldly turned its back on me, ignoring my once prodigious programming talents, callously replacing me with people who are younger and better looking, watching apathetically as my technical skills atrophy each year, forgetting all the great things I have done, and ---&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ahem.&amp;nbsp; Sorry, I got a little off track there.&amp;nbsp; :-)&amp;nbsp; Where was I?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ah yes, my addiction.&amp;nbsp; You see, although my company has grown to the point where it can no longer find a place for me as a coder, I have found it rather difficult to stop.&amp;nbsp; I've got some sort of an addiction, a disease which compels me to write code.&amp;nbsp; It is this mania which has driven me to write things like my &lt;a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/wsol_sold.html"&gt;solitaire game&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href="http://software.ericsink.com/articles/Yours_Mine_Ours.html"&gt;blogging app&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I pretty much always have some kind of a hobby project going on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lately my hours as a compulsive coder are spent working on some ideas for woodworking design software.&amp;nbsp; Since most of my readers are interested in neither woodworking nor solid modeling, I'll spare you the gory details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About five weeks ago I published a few of my early &lt;a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/WPF_for_Laggards.html"&gt;thoughts&lt;/a&gt; on WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation, formerly called "Avalon").&amp;nbsp; My interest in WPF continued to grow, so recently I decided to give it a try by writing a WPF front end for my woodworking software.&amp;nbsp; In the process of doing so, I am becoming a WPF fan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The screen shot below is a picture of my WPF viewer in action:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img border=0 width=576 height=449 src="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/1610_image001.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basically, my woodworking software is designed around the concept of a list of steps.&amp;nbsp; Each step corresponds to one woodworking action, such as cutting a board or attaching two boards together.&amp;nbsp; A primary job of the software is to draw a picture of how the project will look at each step.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the screen shot above, the ListView on the left contains all of the steps to build a simple bookshelf.&amp;nbsp; The larger 3D picture on the right is showing the currently selected step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am certainly still not an expert on WPF, but here is what I like so far:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;It is &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; easy to put cool things into a ListView.&amp;nbsp; In Win32, list controls are very oriented toward text.&amp;nbsp; WPF has no such bias.&amp;nbsp; I wanted my ListView control to have a little preview picture of each step.&amp;nbsp; This was really simple to do with WPF.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;WPF 3D is &lt;i&gt;far&lt;/i&gt; simpler to use than Managed DirectX.&amp;nbsp; That's kind of a remarkable thing to say when you consider that Managed DirectX is &lt;i&gt;far&lt;/i&gt; simpler than using DirectX from unmanaged code.&amp;nbsp; I was able to get excellent results from the 3D features of WPF in very little time.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle&gt; &lt;li &gt;Obviously, there are tradeoffs.&amp;nbsp; For example, I haven't found a way to do volumetric textures using the 3D features in WPF.&amp;nbsp; Still, those tradeoffs seem worth the trouble.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;li &gt;I haven't tried it yet, but apparently WPF is supposed to be able to &lt;i&gt;print&lt;/i&gt; my 3D stuff.&amp;nbsp; That's a pretty big win, since I expected printing support to be a heckuva lot of work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;I have found XAML to be very nice, after I got past the initial learning curve.&amp;nbsp; At first, XAML looked like a bunch of nonsense on my screen.&amp;nbsp; It didn't take too long to find myself just typing tags and attributes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;The Visual Studio support for WPF and XAML is more useful than I thought.&amp;nbsp; The visual UI designer is basically useless, but installing "Cider" also adds other WPF support to Visual Studio 2005, including special project actions and Intellisense.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;The WPF samples in the Windows SDK are quite helpful.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;The WPF documentation?&amp;nbsp; Not so much.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Since everything in WPF is built on DirectX, controls and 3D stuff don't seem to mind sharing the screen with each other.&amp;nbsp; When I was using Managed DirectX with Windows Forms, I couldn't find any easy way to have my 3D view show up in the same window as my controls.&amp;nbsp; With WPF, this is trivial.&amp;nbsp; As the screen shot shows, I have my Viewport3D in the same window as a couple of ListView controls.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Finally, here is the coolest example of how smooth this integration is:&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=circle&gt; &lt;li &gt;The preview pictures in the ListView are actually not pictures -- they are little Viewport3D objects.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;With the Trackball class from &lt;a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/danlehen/default.aspx"&gt;Daniel Lehenbauer&lt;/a&gt;, I can use the mouse to rotate and zoom the model.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;I have hooked up all the little viewports in the ListView to the same Trackball as the main view.&amp;nbsp; So, when I rotate or zoom the model on the right, those little previews in the ListView are automatically updated as well.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;This is what I call Deeply Neato.&amp;nbsp; It's easier to appreciate when you watch it happen, so I captured a &lt;a href="http://software.ericsink.com/entries/sawdust.avi"&gt;short movie&lt;/a&gt; (4.5 MB AVI, 12 seconds).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I suppose I will soon bump into some sort of a wall, but so far, I think WPF is really nice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>The ONE key thing to know about negotiation</title>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Most people &lt;i&gt;hate&lt;/i&gt; to negotiate.&amp;nbsp; They don't like the confrontational aspect.&amp;nbsp; They worry that they are not getting a good deal.&amp;nbsp; They feel stress and fear.&amp;nbsp; Some people will do almost anything to avoid it.&amp;nbsp; Saturn built an entire car company around this sentiment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But good negotiation skills are valuable for anyone, and essential for an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of books on the topic of negotiation.&amp;nbsp; But when I go to my local bookstore and see those books on the shelf, I can't help but think that the topic is getting blown out of proportion.&amp;nbsp; In my experience, negotiation just isn't that complicated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I've done lots of negotiation.&amp;nbsp; I've argued with car salesmen.&amp;nbsp; I've done consulting deals at four, five and six figures.&amp;nbsp; I've closed a million-dollar technology sale.&amp;nbsp; I've haggled with gypsies over the price of a table cloth in rural Spain.&amp;nbsp; Through it all, there is one principle that matters more than anything else.&amp;nbsp; Here it is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:14.0pt'&gt;In negotiation, the one thing that really strengthens your position is the ability to walk away from the deal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sounds simple, right?&amp;nbsp; It should be, but people still get themselves into all kinds of trouble.&amp;nbsp; Most people think the key to negotiation is figuring out how to manipulate the other person's perspective.&amp;nbsp; I'll admit that those tactics can be somewhat effective, but the genuine ability to walk away from a deal is far more powerful.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Negotiating from a position of real need is a bad, bad situation.&amp;nbsp; You are almost certainly going to lose.&amp;nbsp; The other party will push until they find your threshold of pain.&amp;nbsp; Examples here include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;Bartering about salary when you are unemployed.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Raising venture capital when your company is almost out of cash.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Buying a car when you really have to buy one.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realize that things happen which are beyond our control.&amp;nbsp; Some of these situations are unfortunate and unavoidable.&amp;nbsp; But in any negotiation, your best investment is to figure out a way to get by if the deal falls through.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Practice this principle the next time you buy a car:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1&gt; &lt;li &gt;Start shopping for a car &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; you really need to.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Before starting the negotiation for any specific vehicle, clearly understand your fallback plan.&amp;nbsp; What will you do if you don't get this car?&amp;nbsp; Buy something else?&amp;nbsp; Take the bus?&amp;nbsp; Ride your bike?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Don't let yourself get emotionally attached to the car until it's yours.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Figure out in advance what you want to pay.&amp;nbsp; If you can't get the deal you want, walk out.&amp;nbsp; You can always come back later if you want.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;My current vehicle is a Chevy Avalanche.&amp;nbsp; When I was shopping for it, I went to my local Chevy dealer, picked out a truck, figured out what I wanted to pay, and made an offer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sales guy smiled at me and said, "That's absurd."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I calmly replied, "I am quite certain you will make a profit if you sell me this truck at the price I have offered.&amp;nbsp; It won't be your most profitable deal this month, but you'll make money, and you'll get a vehicle off your lot.&amp;nbsp; But either way, I am going to buy a Chevy Avalanche.&amp;nbsp; Somebody is going to accept this offer.&amp;nbsp; The only question is whether it's going to be you or somebody else."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, the sales guy started playing games and I walked out.&amp;nbsp; Two days later I made the same offer to his competitor in a nearby town and drove home in my new truck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you're buying or selling, whether it's a car or a table cloth or a company, the principle always works the same way.&amp;nbsp; The way to get burned is to spend all your time daydreaming about how wonderful things will be after the deal is done.&amp;nbsp; The way to win is to carefully figure out how tolerable things will be after the deal falls through.&amp;nbsp; In almost every case, the winner of a negotiation is the party who is best prepared for the possibility of the deal not happening at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Five Things Every Micro-ISV Should Know About Intellectual Property</title>
      <id>http://software.ericsink.com/articles/Intellectual_Property.html</id>
      <link>http://software.ericsink.com/articles/Intellectual_Property.html</link>
      <published>Fri, 23 Jun 2006 07:00:00 CST</published>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Running a Micro-ISV is different from running a more traditional small business.&amp;nbsp; We don't sell tangible property like hammers or cheeseburgers.&amp;nbsp; Our products are intangible.&amp;nbsp; Our business model exists only because governments have intellectual property laws which allow us to exclusively own certain rights and to control the terms under which we trade some of those rights for money.&amp;nbsp; It seems rather important that we have a basic understanding of these laws.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am not a lawyer.&amp;nbsp; Nothing I say in this article should be construed as providing legal advice.&amp;nbsp; I'm just providing some &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; basic information.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; Copyrights, trademarks, and patents are all different.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, the law defines three main forms of intellectual property:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;Copyrights are used to protect a specific expression of something.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Trademarks are used to protect a distinctive symbol or name which is used to identify a business or product.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Patents are used to trademark an invention such as a method or process.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many people tend to confuse these terms.&amp;nbsp; For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;It makes no sense to ask if the word "podcast" is copyrighted.&amp;nbsp; You can't copyright a word.&amp;nbsp; That's what trademarks are for.&amp;nbsp; .&amp;nbsp; If I develop a new database and call it Oracle, I am violating a trademark, not a copyright.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Similarly, don't ask if HTML is patented.&amp;nbsp; You can't patent a markup language.&amp;nbsp; Rather, ask if there are any patented methods which are related to HTML.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;These three concepts are distinct.&amp;nbsp; Every Micro-ISV will use copyrights.&amp;nbsp; Many will use trademarks.&amp;nbsp; A few will use patents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; Copyrights are simple.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The owner of a copyright has the exclusive right to control the reproduction of something.&amp;nbsp; Copyrights protect a specific expression of something.&amp;nbsp; A song can be copyrighted, thus making it illegal to make copies of that song without permission.&amp;nbsp; A piece of software can be copyrighted, thus making it illegal to make copies of that software without permission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Copyrights are the most important form of intellectual property protection for a Micro-ISV.&amp;nbsp; When I create a piece of software and start selling other people the right to use a copy of it, it is important to me that anyone who makes illegal copies of my software is violating the law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Luckily, copyrights are also the most simple form of intellectual property protection.&amp;nbsp; There are no special steps to become the owner of a copyright.&amp;nbsp; When I create a piece of software, I implicitly and automatically own a copyright on my work.&amp;nbsp; The government allows me to register that copyright if I want, and doing so may strengthen my position in a court battle, but registration is not essential.&amp;nbsp; I simply label my work "Copyright 2006 Eric Sink", and that's enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; Trademarks are freaky.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A trademark protects the logo or name that you use to identify your business or product.&amp;nbsp; It would unfair for me to start selling a database product called Oracle.&amp;nbsp; Customers would get confused.&amp;nbsp; The law protects Oracle Corporation by granting them the exclusive right to use that word in the sale of database products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, trademarks are kind of freaky, for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;&lt;b&gt;A registered trademark is very different from an unregistered trademark.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;Just as with copyrights, you don't have to register anything with the government to get trademark protection.&amp;nbsp; However, unlike the situation with copyrights, a registered trademark is very different from an unregistered one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;Registering a trademark is expensive and very time-consuming.&amp;nbsp; You should get a lawyer to help you.&amp;nbsp; Plan to spend $1,000 or more.&amp;nbsp; It will probably take more than a year to complete the process.&amp;nbsp; Your application might get denied.&amp;nbsp; However, if you successfully get your trademark registered, you end up with very strong protection.&amp;nbsp; With a registered trademark, you can put the circle-R symbol next to your mark whenever you use it.&amp;nbsp; If someone violates your mark, you are very likely to win a resulting lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;Proceeding with an unregistered trademark is simpler.&amp;nbsp; Just put (tm) next to your logo or name.&amp;nbsp; That's it.&amp;nbsp; By doing so, you are simply informing the world of your claim to the exclusive use of the mark.&amp;nbsp; If you find yourself in conflict with some other party, you might win, or you might not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;&lt;b&gt;A trademark is limited in scope.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;You can't globally trademark something for all kinds of situations.&amp;nbsp; Your trademark protection is valid only for the industry or market segment in which you are doing business.&amp;nbsp; I can't start selling a database product called Oracle, but I am perfectly free to start selling a toothpaste called Oracle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;&lt;b&gt;If you don't defend your trademark, you lose it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;Trademark law says that your mark is protected by law only if you are actively protecting it.&amp;nbsp; If someone violates your mark, you must object.&amp;nbsp; If you don't, you have weakened your position for any situation that comes up later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; Patents are absurd.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A patent is the strongest form of intellectual property protection.&amp;nbsp; Patents are used to protect a method or technique, regardless of its expression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With copyrights, accidental infringement is more or less impossible.&amp;nbsp; If I start selling a spreadsheet product which is byte-for-byte identical to Microsoft Excel, nobody is going to believe me when I claim that I just happened to come up with the same string of bits that Microsoft did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In contrast, accidental infringement of a patent is quite possible.&amp;nbsp; Microsoft Excel is probably covered by a whole bunch of patents.&amp;nbsp; If I create a spreadsheet product, the likelihood that I may use a patented technique is rather high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Software patents today are primarily used in one of two ways:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;Companies like Microsoft are building up large collections of patents.&amp;nbsp; In general, their patent arsenal is a defensive weapon.&amp;nbsp; They have patents so that they can counter-sue whenever somebody sues them for patent infringement.&amp;nbsp; Microsoft gets sued regularly over patent issues.&amp;nbsp; I cannot think of a single case where Microsoft sued a small company over a patent issue.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;Patent Trolls are companies which do nothing but purchase patents and use them to threaten and sue other companies.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am not opposed to software patents in principle, but I do believe patent law needs to be reformed.&amp;nbsp; Patents carry a 17 year term, which is far too long for software.&amp;nbsp; Patents are being granted for "inventions" which are obvious.&amp;nbsp; Patent trolls should be banned and violators should be sentenced to a lifetime of driving around Boston.&amp;nbsp; The current situation is absurd.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obtaining a patent is even more costly and time-consuming than a registered trademark.&amp;nbsp; Plan to spend $25,000 or more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patents can be valuable, but a Micro-ISV can have a long and healthy life without ever obtaining one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;5.&amp;nbsp; Licenses are virtual.&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a practical standpoint, buying software is often very simple.&amp;nbsp; I run to Best Buy and grab a copy of Doom 3.&amp;nbsp; I give the cashier 50 bucks.&amp;nbsp; Simple.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From a legal perspective, the transaction was a lot more complicated.&amp;nbsp; First of all, it is important to note that I have not purchased any copyrights, trademarks or patents.&amp;nbsp; All that stuff is still owned by the publisher and developer of the game.&amp;nbsp; Because they own the intellectual property, the law gives them certain exclusive rights.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rather, I have purchased a box, a CD-ROM, and a license.&amp;nbsp; This license is not a physical thing, but a legal concept.&amp;nbsp; The license grants me certain rights, subject to certain restrictions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don't confuse the notion of a license with any of the things that are often associated with it:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;When I buy software, I may get something called a serial number, CD key, activation code, or license key.&amp;nbsp; This is not a license.&amp;nbsp; It is merely something which is designed to encourage or require me to comply with the restrictions of the license.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;When I buy software, I may get a printed license agreement booklet.&amp;nbsp; This is not a license.&amp;nbsp; It is a document which describes the license.&amp;nbsp; Photocopying that document does not increase the number of licenses I have.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;When I buy a computer with Windows XP, I may find a holographic sticker on the back.&amp;nbsp; This sticker is not a license.&amp;nbsp; It is a physical item which represents the license and which may be used to prove that I have a license.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think of as two things:&amp;nbsp; Rights and restrictions.&amp;nbsp; The recipient of the license gets certain rights, subject to certain restrictions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Further Information&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember, I am not a lawyer.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, this little article merely scratches the surface of a rather large subject.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, you have just read an article which is terribly incomplete and which was written by someone with no credibility at all.&amp;nbsp; You are worse off than you were when you started.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To fix this problem, you should probably do two things:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1&gt; &lt;li &gt;&lt;b&gt;Find a lawyer&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Try to find one that genuinely wants to help you succeed in your business.&amp;nbsp; Try to avoid working with any lawyer whose basic mission is to make you afraid of everything.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more stuff&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; A few suggested books:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=a&gt; &lt;li &gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1413300871/sawdust08-20"&gt;Web &amp;amp;

&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;Yes, I know, there are actually four main areas of intellectual property law, not three.&amp;nbsp;

&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp; Why don't sharks attack lawyers?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style='margin-left:.5in'&gt;&lt;i&gt;A:&amp;nbsp; Professional courtesy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <summary>&lt;p&gt;The connotation of the term "Web 2.0" is that the Web is a piece of software in its second major version.&amp;nbsp; The term implies that there was a version 1.0 and that there will probably be a version 3.0.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I find myself wanting to ask the kind of questions I normally ask when I see a software product at version 2.0:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;What is the feature set of the current version?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;What are its known bugs?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;What can I expect from the next version?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;When will the next version be available?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I could certainly respond to these questions by writing about some of the very positive things I see on the Web today.&amp;nbsp; The Web is incredible!&amp;nbsp; Remember back when the "What's New" page at NCSA was a listing of basically every site on the Web?&amp;nbsp; We've come a long way.&amp;nbsp; There are some amazing things happening in this version of the Web.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But right now I'm in a "glass half empty" sort of mood.&amp;nbsp; When I look at the state of the Web today, one big thing jumps out at me:&amp;nbsp; The defining characteristic of this version of the Web is the people who are ruining it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This past weekend I was bidding on a guitar on eBay.&amp;nbsp; Shortly before the auction ended, I received email from the seller offering to end the auction early.&amp;nbsp; Believing that the seller was trying to do something unethical, I stopped bidding and somebody else won.&amp;nbsp; Only later did I realize that the email was actually sent by someone impersonating the seller.&amp;nbsp; The auction was apparently legit.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shortly after the auction ended, I received a "Second Chance" offer from the seller.&amp;nbsp; This time I was more discerning of the fraud.&amp;nbsp; Like the first one, this email was not really from the seller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then I received two more of these Second Chance offers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then in morning I got three more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At last count, I have received email from 13 different people offering to sell me the guitar I did not win.&amp;nbsp; The laughable part of this story is that the manufacturer only made 12 of this particular model.&amp;nbsp; There are exactly 12 of these guitars on the planet and I've got 13 people offering to sell me one!&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;:-)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn't actually give money to any of the 13 crooks who tried to cheat me.&amp;nbsp; I'm not really upset about losing the auction.&amp;nbsp; What distresses me here is that these 13 people won, and the rest of us lost:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc&gt; &lt;li &gt;I lost the chance to buy the guitar I wanted.&amp;nbsp; [footnote 1]&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;The seller lost money.&amp;nbsp; I don't know if I would have won the auction or not, but the seller would have received a higher price than he did.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;eBay lost credibility.&amp;nbsp; Every time fraud shows up in the proximity of an eBay auction, eBay's reputation takes another hit.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know I'm not the first one to be shocked and frustrated about the presence of evil in the world.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I'm just shouting at the rain, but sometimes a little shouting feels good, especially when this is just the tip of the iceberg.&amp;nbsp; There are &lt;i&gt;many&lt;/i&gt; examples of fraud or vandalism on the Web today.&amp;nbsp; Here are just a few other obvious examples:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol style='margin-top:0in' start=1 type=1&gt; &lt;li &gt;For Google's advertising business, click fraud is out of control.&amp;nbsp; [footnote 2]&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;For individual computers, viruses are out of control.&amp;nbsp; [footnote 3]&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li &gt;For email, spam is out of control.&amp;nbsp; [footnote 4]&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I could go on with more examples, but you get the idea.&amp;nbsp; The Web today is enormous.&amp;nbsp; It is used by hundreds of millions of people, perhaps billions.&amp;nbsp; A small percentage of those people are causing a lot of damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel sad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems like the current version of the Web has a flaw.&amp;nbsp; In the real world, it is always easier to destroy than to build, but this disparity seems to be magnified on the Web.&amp;nbsp; People who are actively working to make the Web a better place are climbing uphill pulling a heavy trailer.&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, the spammers and fraudsters are coasting in their convertible with the top down.&amp;nbsp; I hope the next version of the Web has some improvements in this area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, I don't have any solutions to offer right now.&amp;nbsp; I'm just having one of those moments where a realization is hitting me hard:&amp;nbsp; These "evildoers" are becoming the primary influencers of my experience on the Web today.&amp;nbsp; [footnote 5]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt'&gt;[1]&amp;nbsp; Yes, the auction was partly my fault.&amp;nbsp; If I were more experienced with eBay, I would have been less gullible and would have continued bidding.&amp;nbsp; Next time, I will know better, but that's still a workaround for the real bug.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt'&gt;[2]&amp;nbsp; I've read so many stories about click fraud lately that I don't know which one to link.&amp;nbsp; More and more, I hear people saying that they no longer run their AdWords on the content network.&amp;nbsp; We don't.&amp;nbsp; The content clicks were a major fraction of our AdWords spending, and we were getting no measurable value from them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt'&gt;[3]&amp;nbsp; Yes, viruses pre-date the Web, but the Web has given them a more effective delivery vehicle.&amp;nbsp; BTW, three weeks ago I had to repave my machine because of a virus.&amp;nbsp; The Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) offered to remove the virus, and I said yes.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, its concept of removing the virus is simply to remove all the files which are infected.&amp;nbsp; The MSRT could have saved me a lot of time by simply popping up a dialog box that said, "Your system is irretrievably fouled up.&amp;nbsp; Get some coffee, back up your files, and reformat the hard disk."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt'&gt;[4]&amp;nbsp; The guy who administers our network at SourceGear told me recently that less than five percent of the mail we receive is legitimate.&amp;nbsp; BTW, I think we need to stop saying that the spammers only continue because they make money doing it.&amp;nbsp; Virus writers don't make money.&amp;nbsp; They write viruses simply for the joy of causing harm to others.&amp;nbsp; I don't see much reason to believe that spam would stop if the financial incentive were magically removed somehow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:10.0pt'&gt;[5]&amp;nbsp; And who are these evildoers anyway?&amp;nbsp; Considering the enormous impact they have on the Web today, it seems wrong for them to be so invisible.&amp;nbsp; Why aren't they blogging?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt; Given that practically every non-financial protected website I frequent offers password recovery or reset via email (&lt;em&gt;forget your password?),&lt;/em&gt; I don't think passwords are even necessary for these sites. A time-limited security token issued through weekly or monthly email containing a URL with one-time password effectively removes the need for passwords. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I am calling it &lt;em&gt;mail-in authentication&lt;/em&gt; for lack of a better name. The intention is to replace those 'signin' and 'login' buttons with 'mail-in' buttons. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is how mail-in authentication would work from user experience point of view: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; User registers at the site by entering an email address. &lt;li&gt; User opens the email and clicks on&amp;nbsp;the authentication&amp;nbsp;link. &lt;li&gt; Site issues a time-limited token cookie containing user and device identity hints. User is signed in at this point. &lt;li&gt; Next time User visits the Site, user signs-in automatically unless the token is bad or lost. &lt;li&gt; When the token is not accepted for whatever reason (expired, failed validation, flagged as being used in a replay attack elsewhere, deleted, or roaming), User is returned to step 1.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt; Note that there is one password still needed, the one used to access email. That's where Kinda comes from. In this scheme, email password becomes the universal password of sort. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While I don't recommend this authentication scheme for web applications with medium to high security needs, I think it's acceptable for low level security needs. It certainly simplifies UX and UI. For roaming needs, temporary session token can be issued automatically when access from an unknown device is detected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img width="0" height="0" src="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/aggbug.ashx?id=13f1c249-44cd-4052-b0bb-f6025d6a0299"&gt;</summary>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=13f1c249-44cd-4052-b0bb-f6025d6a0299<category term="Technical"/>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/08/16/HNactivegrideclipse_1.html"&gt;ActiveGrid is joining the Eclipse gang&lt;/a&gt;. Peter probably doesn't remember because he was too busy making the pitch but I advised him to consider building on Eclipse nearly two years ago. Maybe billing him for the advice might have made him take it more seriously. It was a serious mistake to not leverage all the momentum building up behind Eclipse. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Well, it's better late than never. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img width="0" height="0" src="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/aggbug.ashx?id=a05b5b8a-fcf7-4f5b-82a7-bfe2f52a6041"&gt;</summary>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=a05b5b8a-fcf7-4f5b-82a7-bfe2f52a6041<category term="Technical"/>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt; Looks like &lt;a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=87576b0c-0f70-4913-9742-2541a512dc41"&gt;W3C is still on it's downward spiral&lt;/a&gt;. I've had my own hits and bumps with W3C and it took me a long time to wash that W3C taste out of my mind. Looking back, I think what the world needs a more modern form of standardization process for technology related standards, one that supports incremental improvements and immediate deployment as well as ability to fix past mistakes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As an engineer and an entrepreneur, I often have 'this needs to be standardized' moments. The need can vary in size from large to small and type from trail-breaking to fence-mending. Needless to say, the distance from such a moment to watching the printer spend an hour printing out the final recommendation is beyond bearable. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; What I would like is a place where I can go to find others to quickly find others with similar interest then workout common solutions in weeks instead of years a W3C standardization process usually takes. Note that there is no process, just a place. The rest is left to the people to work out, somehow, driven by their needs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The place is both a social network as well as a battlefield&amp;nbsp;for de-facto standard makers, a place that depends on nimbleness of its occupants to make up for mistakes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img width="0" height="0" src="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/aggbug.ashx?id=85f423c8-7874-4daa-92d6-a9ef0163d1dd"&gt;</summary>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=85f423c8-7874-4daa-92d6-a9ef0163d1dd<category term="Technical"/>

      <summary>&lt;p&gt; My wife and son are returning today from a long visit to Korea. Believe it or not, this annual visit was one of the things I promised when we married 14&amp;nbsp;years ago because she is very close to her parents. The trip is usually a month long but this time she was a way for half a month longer. Needless to say, I missed them both pretty badly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I hope they arrive safely. I had a bad dream of my wife this morning, bad enough to call to delay her flight if she wasn't already airborne. Now I am so nervous that I can't focus on anything. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; They arrived safely and smiling because the airline upgraded their seats to business class after she complained about something at the departing end. A bit of wisdom according to my wife: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;In America, you are rewarded for being nice. In Korea, you get ignored instead. To get better service in Korea, you have to get nasty.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p dir=ltr&gt; Rather sad but my experience agrees with hers. Until things improve, don't bother waiting in line when in Korea. Just go right up to the counter, ignoring those already there, and talk to the person behind the counter in a loud clear voice, even if the person is already talking to another customer. Note that some things are common across cultures. If you yell, &lt;em&gt;'I need a box of condoms!'&lt;/em&gt;, you'll be stared at no matter where you are. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img width="0" height="0" src="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/aggbug.ashx?id=53bf2939-341c-4522-b913-9905ac5037ea"&gt;</summary>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=53bf2939-341c-4522-b913-9905ac5037ea<category term="General"/>

The news is even bigger in &lt;a href="http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-eastasia.asp?parentid=50672"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;. Watching an event unfold in two languages is confusing though. In Korea, the technology is called WiBro and is being presented as a technology developed mostly in Korea. In the US, it's called WiMax and Korea is only part of the picture. Hmm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I think Sprint is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; rolling out &lt;strong&gt;WiMax&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;but &lt;strong&gt;Mobile WiMax&lt;/strong&gt; which is called &lt;strong&gt;WiBro&lt;/strong&gt; in Korea. WiMax and Mobile WiMax differs in that devices will work even while moving at fairly high speed. I don't know what, if any, advantages regular WiMax has over Mobile WiMax though. The exciting thing about Mobile WiMax is that it may eventually get fast enough to download a movie faster than I can drive to the nearest BlockBuster. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A funny bit: Qualcomm is synonymous with vampire in Korea because of all the royalties&amp;nbsp;they made&amp;nbsp;with CDMA. So Mobile WiMax is a &lt;a href="http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200608/200608110027.html"&gt;sweet revenge&lt;/a&gt; of sort. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;img width="0" height="0" src="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/aggbug.ashx?id=2dfa742a-c40f-4338-86f7-b4ed9dc348f1"&gt;</summary>http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=2dfa742a-c40f-4338-86f7-b4ed9dc348f1<category term="General"/>

      <title>In-line tagging at LibraryThing</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Tim Spalding has taken &lt;a href="http://www.librarything.com/blog/2006/08/forums-are-broken-introducing.php"&gt;discussion forums a big step forward&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;a href="http://www.LibraryThing.com"&gt;LibraryThing&lt;/a&gt;. The concept is simple but could make a real difference because it allows forum msgs to be aggregated in multiple ways. When you&amp;#8217;re entering a msg at a forum, you can put a title or author in brackets and LibraryThing will take a stab at identifying what you have in mind. Think of it as in-place tagging. You can thus easily find all the posts about a book. And all the references to a book or author will be lilsted on that book or author&amp;#8217;s page. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because LibraryThing knows which books you own (because you&amp;#8217;ve told it), it can feed you msgs about any of them. And, as Tim points out, this unhiding of msgs will change the temporality of posts: Rather than msgs fading into obscurity a few days or weeks after they&amp;#8217;re posted, they&amp;#8217;ll be easily findable and reply-able.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very cool. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?a=PmLlwA"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?i=PmLlwA" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?a=xPuC3Fe9"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?i=xPuC3Fe9" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Many-to-many/~4/11299871"/&gt;</summary>

      <title>number games and social software</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Over the last month, i&amp;#8217;ve been driving Mimi&amp;#8217;s Hybrid on and off. One of my favorite things about the Hybrid is that it tells you how many &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPG &lt;/span&gt;you&amp;#8217;re averaging over time. I find myself driving around town trying to maximize that number, getting uber excited when it goes up and super sad when it goes down. It reminds me of when i used to try to maximize my miles per hour when going from Boston to New York only this is more environmental. Yet, it&amp;#8217;s not the environment that i&amp;#8217;m concerning myself with - it&amp;#8217;s all about number games in the same way that people obsess over every pound on the scale or the calories in every bite. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then i was thinking about Tantek and Jason raving about Consumating. I love the fact that it&amp;#8217;s a lot of cool geeky people but i can never get over the lameness that i feel when i log in and look at my score. And yet, i can&amp;#8217;t be bothered to answer the questions that make me feel all uncomfortable in the hopes that someone will like my answers and rate me higher. It&amp;#8217;s a catch-22 for me. Yet, i totally understand why Tantek and Jason and others absolutely love it and why they go back for more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then i was thinking about the people on Yahoo! Answers who spend hours every day answering questions to get high ranks. It&amp;#8217;s very similar to Consumating only it&amp;#8217;s not all embarassing because it&amp;#8217;s not really about you - it&amp;#8217;s about the answers. There&amp;#8217;s no real gain from getting points but still, it&amp;#8217;s like a mouse in a cage determined to do well just cuz they can. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This all reminds me of a scene in some movie. I can&amp;#8217;t recall what movie it was but it was about how you just want to be the best at &lt;strong&gt;something&lt;/strong&gt;, anything&amp;#8230; to have something to point at and say look, i&amp;#8217;m #1! The validation, the proof of greatness! Even if that something is problematic attention getting like being the #1 serial killer. (Was it Bowling for Columbine?)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I started wondering about these number games&amp;#8230; They&amp;#8217;re all over social software - Neopets, friends on social network sites, blog visitors, etc. Who is motivated by what number games? Who is demotivated? Does it make a difference if the number game is about the group vs. the individual, about one&amp;#8217;s self directly vs. about some abstract capability?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are there some number games that work better than others in attracting a broader audience? I&amp;#8217;m thinking about Orkut here&amp;#8230; if the game is to get as many Brazillians on the site as possible, you only need a few obsessives to be the rallying forces; everyone else is part of the number game simply by signing up. So there are tons competing in the number games but only a few invested. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does anyone know anything about how these number games work as incentives?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Also posted at &lt;a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2006/08/07/number_games_an.html"&gt;Apophenia&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?a=m5hs3w"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?i=m5hs3w" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?a=GPQjjU3c"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?i=GPQjjU3c" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Many-to-many/~4/9794457"/&gt;</summary>

      <title>Culture Jams, Culture Preserves</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This post is via my &lt;a href="http://www.paulbhartzog.org" target="_blank"&gt;Paul B. Hartzog&lt;/a&gt; blog, but I realized that I should&amp;#8217;ve posted it here, so here goes&amp;#8230;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I recently read &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html"&gt;The Rise of Crowdsourcing&lt;/a&gt; over at Wired (the author, Jeff Howe, has a blog on the topic at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.crowdsourcing.com"&gt;http://www.crowdsourcing.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The article mentions that &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.istockphoto.com/"&gt;iStockphoto&lt;/a&gt; (cheap stock photography via the Internet) has obliterated the &amp;#8220;future for professional stock photography.&amp;#8221; (Similarly, Clay Shirky &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/weblogs_publishing.html"&gt;noted way back when&lt;/a&gt; that blogs &amp;#8220;are such an efficient tool for distributing the written word that they make publishing a financially worthless activity.&amp;#8221;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But more importantly, the Wired article discusses the rise of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;R&amp;amp;D &lt;/span&gt;networking. For example, InnoCentive matches problems and problem-solvers: “The strength of a network like InnoCentive’s is exactly the diversity of intellectual background&amp;#8230;. We actually found the odds of a solver’s success increased in fields in which they had no formal expertise.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, just this year, Chevy attempted its own kind of crowdsourcing, allowing website visitors to apply their own text input over Chevy Tahoe footage to create-your-own-commercial. What they got was a barrage of anti-pollution, anti-accident, and just-about-anti-anything creations. (See them at YouTube: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://youtube.com/results?search=chevy+tahoe"&gt;http://youtube.com/results?search=chevy+tahoe&lt;/a&gt;). One participant even launched &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://heavyonthechevy.crispynews.com/"&gt;a website where you can rate the videos&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using existing mass media images to twist, mock, refute, subvert, or &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_jamming"&gt;as wikipedia more politely says&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;produce negative commentary about itself&amp;#8221; is called &amp;#8220;culture jamming.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Umberto Eco calls this &amp;#8220;semiological guerrilla warfare&amp;#8221; and supports &amp;#8220;action which would urge the audience to control the message and its multiple possibilities of interpretation.&amp;#8221; (from &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156913216"&gt;Travels in Hyperreality&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what happens when the culture jammers actually want to continue and extend the media in question?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, last year Wired ran &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.12/startrek.html"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; about some Star Trek fans who make their own episodes, which eventually culminated in &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/18/arts/television/18trek.html"&gt;this article at The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. (See the fan-vids: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.newvoyages.com/"&gt;http://www.newvoyages.com/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.ussintrepid.org.uk/"&gt;http://www.ussintrepid.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.hiddenfrontier.com/"&gt;http://www.hiddenfrontier.com/&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.starshipexeter.com/"&gt;http://www.starshipexeter.com/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fans are saying, look, if we can&amp;#8217;t get what we want on television, the technology is out there for us to do it ourselves&amp;#8230;. It has become so popular that Walter Koenig, the actor who played Chekov in the original &amp;#8220;Star Trek,&amp;#8221; is guest starring in an episode, and George Takei, who played Sulu, is slated to shoot another one later this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the Star Trek franchise has a real opportunity here that could be taken as a crowdsourcing lesson to other media producers (music, film, books, etc.). Here it comes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free the content!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let the Star Trek fans take the initiative and spend the money to keep the interest-level going, crank out a studio movie once in a while, foster crossovers between shows, organize events, provide financial assistance, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is what &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/speaking/index.html"&gt;Rebecca Blood calls &amp;#8220;participatory culture,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/weblogs_publishing.html"&gt;Clay Shirky &amp;#8220;mass amateurization.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/166/report_display.asp"&gt;Pew Internet &amp;amp; American Life Project released this study&lt;/a&gt; which states that &amp;#8220;57 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds online – 12 million individuals – are creating content of some sort and posting it to the Web.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So if culture &lt;em&gt;jams&lt;/em&gt; are the result of the appropriation of mass media images for negative commentary, then the same process used for positive purposes would result in culture &lt;em&gt;preserves&lt;/em&gt;, no?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kick out the preserves!&lt;/strong&gt; ;-)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?a=XHwA29"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?i=XHwA29" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?a=sr01iQM7"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?i=sr01iQM7" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Many-to-many/~4/6117508"/&gt;</summary>

      <title>The Power of Conversation Redux</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;In September of 2005, I posted &lt;a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2005/09/11/the_power_of_conversation.php" target="_blank"&gt;&amp;#8220;The Power of Conversation&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; in which I suggested:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &amp;#8220;The real value of communicative technologies like social software is that they re-enable and enhance our ability to use a time-tested means of information processing, i.e. the conversation, in new and interesting ways!&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, today I caught &lt;a href="http://www.demos.co.uk//projects/talkusintoit/overview " target="_blank"&gt;&amp;#8220;The role of conversation in a changing society and public realm&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; Conversation has long been the cornerstone of our society. New technologies enable us to speak to people anytime, anywhere. However, there is growing concern – both in the UK and elsewhere - that we are talking less than we used to. This work suggests that this is a misconception and that the issue is actually much more complex. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(thx to &lt;a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archive/2006/07/17/the_role_of_con.html" target="_blank"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; over at Howard Rheingold&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.smartmobs.com" target="_blank"&gt;Smart Mobs&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robert Putnam&amp;#8217;s book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743203046" target="_blank"&gt;Bowling Alone&lt;/a&gt; catalyzed the debate about the decline of community. Putnam, like many others, suffered from ontological blinders. By defining community in a narrow way, he failed to see forms of community that didn&amp;#8217;t fit his narrow definition. But:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; The adherence to outdated ways of thinking about social involvement have intensified concern about our sense of community. The way that we engage with those around us has changed. We no longer necessarily connect with either conventional structures like community societies or even less formal associative fora, like markets. Community involvement remains of vital importance, but structures of engagement no longer reflect the ways in which people are comfortable in having their say.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This problem is also rampant in politics where scholars who focus on the primacy of nation-states ignore transnational social organization, and scholars who focus on the structures of formal government fail to notice the networks of informal governance that are emerging across the globe. The bottom line is that technology ushers in new forms of social organization that escape notice &lt;b&gt;precisely because they are invisible to adherents of the old paradigm.&lt;/b&gt; By the time anyone notices the impending social transformation, it is too powerful to contain, and social transformation cascades across the landscape. Or so the theory goes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what about conversation? Well, I venture to suggest that it is through conversation, the connecting of people with other people, the exchange of ideas, the spread of information, debate, dissent, and empathy, that collective wisdom arises. Furthermore, given the resurgence of violent politics, the ambivalence in the face of environmental crises, and profit-driven enclosure movements like overly restrictive copyright law and the Net Neutrality concern, we could definitely benefit from new forms of social organization as carriers of collective wisdom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?a=D9t2yA"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?i=D9t2yA" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?a=fDDQswyo"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?i=fDDQswyo" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Many-to-many/~4/3612257"/&gt;</summary>

      <title>from architecture to urban planning: technology development in a networked age</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Last week, i had drinks with &lt;a href="http://360.yahoo.com/iancrogers"&gt;Ian Rogers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.reemer.com/"&gt;Kareem Mayan&lt;/a&gt; and we were talking about shifts in the development of technology. Although all of us have made these arguments before in different forms, we hit upon a set of metaphors that i feel the need to highlight. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Complete with references to engineering, technology development was originally seen as a type of formalized production. You design, build and ship products. And then they&amp;#8217;re out in the wild, removed from the production cycle until you make Version 2. Of course, it didn&amp;#8217;t take long for people to realize that when they shipped flaws, they didn&amp;#8217;t need to do a recall. Instead, they could just ship free updates in the form of Version 1.1. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the world went web-a-rific, companies held onto the ship-final-products mentality in its stodgy archaic form. Until the forever-in-beta hit. I, for one, &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; the persistent beta. It signals that the system is continuously updating, never fully baked and meant to be organic. This is the way that it should be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Web development is fundamentally different than packaged software. Because it is the web, there&amp;#8217;s no vast distance between producers and consumers. Distribution channels cross space and time (much to the chagrin of most old skool industries). Particularly when it comes to social software, producers can live inside their creations, directly interact with those using the system, and evolve the system alongside the practices that are emerging. In fact, not only &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; they, they&amp;#8217;re stupid to do anything else. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same revolution has happened in writing. Sure, we still ship books but what does it mean to have the author have direct interaction with the reader like they do in blogging? It&amp;#8217;s almost as though someone revived the author from the dead [1]. And maybe turned hir into a kind of peculiar looking Frankenstein who realizes that things aren&amp;#8217;t quite right in interpretation-land but can&amp;#8217;t make them right no matter what. Regardless, with the author able to directly connect to the reader, one must wonder how the process changes. For example, how is the audience imagined when its presence is persistent? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m reminded of a book by Stewart Brand - &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140139966/apophenia-20"&gt;How Building Learn&lt;/a&gt;. In it, Brand talks about how buildings evolve over time based on their use and the aging that takes place. A building is not just the end-result of the designer, but co-constructed by the designer, nature, and the inhabitant over time. When i started thinking about technology as architecture, i realized the significance of that book. We cannot think about technologies as finalized products, but as evolving architectures. This should affect the design process at the getgo, but it also highlights the differences between physical and digital architectures. What would it mean if 92 million people were living in the house simultaneously with different expectations for what colors the walls should be painted? What would it mean if the architect was living inside the house and fighting with the family about the intention of the mantel? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The networked nature of web technologies brings the architect into the living room of the house, but the question still remains: what is the responsibility of a live-in architect? Coming in as an authority on the house does no good - in that way, the architect should still be dead. But should the architect just be a glorified fixer-upper/plumber/electrician? Should the architect support the aging of the house to allow it to become eccentric? Should the architect build new additions for the curious tenants? What should the architect be doing? One might think that the architect should just leave the place alone&amp;#8230; but is this how digital sites evolve? Do they just need plumbers and electricians? Perhaps the architect is not just an architect but also an urban planner&amp;#8230; It is not just the house that is of concern, but the entire city. How the city evolves depends on a whole variety of forces that are constantly in flux. Negotiating this large-scale system is daunting - the house seems so much more manageable. But 92 million people never lived in a single house together. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;[1] Note to Barthes scholars: i&amp;#8217;m being snippy here. I realize that the author&amp;#8217;s authority should still be contested, that multiple interpretations are still valid, and that the author is still a product of social forces. I also realize that even as i&amp;#8217;m writing this blogpost, its reading will be out of my control, but the reality is that i&amp;#8217;ll still - as author - get all huffy and puffy and try to be understood. Damnit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?a=po0c3z"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?i=po0c3z" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?a=uTxafSf4"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?i=uTxafSf4" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Many-to-many/~4/2919440"/&gt;</summary>

There will also be an Open Space track throughout the meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today (June 19) is the last day for early registration. The chair, Dirk Riehle, informs me that &amp;#8220;you can register but don&amp;#8217;t have to pay right away. So even if you are waiting for travel permission from your boss, you can already register and pay later (or cancel with no hassles).&amp;#8221; Which I&amp;#8217;m going to do right away, as a matter of fact. :) &lt;a href="http://hypertext.expositus.com/information.asp?Page=76&amp;amp;menu=13&amp;amp;type=submenu&amp;amp;print=print"&gt;The registration page is here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?a=vqxlJs"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?i=vqxlJs" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?a=vNPPGDMx"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?i=vNPPGDMx" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Many-to-many?g=36"/&gt;</summary>

      <title>PennTags - When card catalogs meet tags</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;University of Pennsylvania&amp;#8217;s del.icio.us-like &lt;a href="http://tags.library.upenn.edu/tag/film"&gt;PennTags&lt;/a&gt; project allows readers to tag catalogued items. It&amp;#8217;s a great way to track resources for a research project and simultaneously make the results of your forays available to future researchers. In fact, it seems just plain selfish &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to do so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Integrating tagging with the book catalogue (and therefore with the book taxonomy) instantaneously provides the best of both worlds: Structured browsing leads you to nodes with jumping off points into the connections made by others who are putting those nodes into various contexts, and tags lead you back into the structured world organized by experts in structure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My guess is that the folksonomy that emerges will &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; change the existing taxonomy because in a miscellaneous world you don&amp;#8217;t have to change something in order to change it. The existing taxonomy could stay exactly as it is, as the folksonomy supplements it by providing synonyms for existing categories (e.g., a search for &amp;#8220;recipes&amp;#8221; takes you to the &amp;#8220;cuisine&amp;#8221; category of the existing taxonomy) and leaping-off-points from it into the user-created clusters of meaning (e.g., here&amp;#8217;s the tag cloud for the node you&amp;#8217;re browsing). Rather than disrupting, transforming or replacing the existing taxonomy, the folksonomy may just affectionately tousle its hair. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, PennTags looks like a great project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(U of Penn&amp;#8217;s Library Staff Blog is &lt;a href="http://www.library.upenn.edu/blos/staffweb/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. And here is the &lt;a href="http://www.library.upenn.edu/blos/staffweb/newtech"&gt;newtech&lt;/a&gt; category of that blog. On a quick browse, this looks like a terrific resource if you&amp;#8217;re interested in libraries, taxonomies, folksonomies, tagging, etc.) &lt;font style='font-size:80%';&gt;[Tags:&lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/penntags" rel="tag"&gt; penntags&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/laurie+allen" rel="tag"&gt; laurie_allen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/taxonomy" rel="tag"&gt; taxonomy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/libraries" rel="tag"&gt; libraries&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/folksonomy" rel="tag"&gt; folksonomy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/everything+is+miscellaneous" rel="tag"&gt; everything_is_miscellaneous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/tagging" rel="tag"&gt; tagging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/-berkman" rel="tag"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?a=B13vYa"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?i=B13vYa" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?a=HGeZt1DF"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?i=HGeZt1DF" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Many-to-many?g=35"/&gt;</summary>

      <title>Reactions to Digital Maoism</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;Last5 week, Edge.org published Jaron Lanier&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge183.html"&gt;Digital Maoism &lt;/a&gt;piece, warning of the dangers of new collectivism, and singling out Wikipedia for criticism. Today, Edge has several reactions to Lanier&amp;#8217;s warnings, from people who think about social software from a variety of perspectives, including &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html#rushkoff"&gt;Douglas Rushkoff&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html#hardy"&gt;Quentin Hardy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html#benkler"&gt;Yochai Benkler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html#shirky"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; (and I re-print my piece here), &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html#doctorow"&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html#kelly"&gt;Kevin Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html#dysone"&gt;Esther Dyson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html#sanger"&gt;Larry Sanger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html#viegas"&gt;Fernanda Viegas &amp;amp; Martin Wattenberg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html#wales"&gt;Jimmy Wales&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/discourse/digital_maoism.html#dysong"&gt;George Dyson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I include my reaction here as well, as Edge doesn&amp;#8217;t have comments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jaron Lanier is certainly right to look at the downsides of collective action. It&amp;#8217;s not a revolution if nobody loses, and in this case, expertise and iconoclasm are both relegated by some forms of group activity. However, &amp;#8220;Digital Maoism&amp;#8221; mischaracterizes the present situation in two ways. The first is that the target of the piece, the hive mind, is just a catchphrase, used by people who don&amp;#8217;t understand how things like Wikipedia really work. As a result, criticism of the hive mind becomes similarly vague. Second, the initial premise of the piece — there are downsides to collective production of intellectual work — gets spread it so widely that it comes to cover &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS &lt;/span&gt;aggregators, &lt;em&gt;American Idol&lt;/em&gt;, and the editorial judgment of the NY Times. These are errors of overgeneralization; it would be good to have a conversation about Wikipedia&amp;#8217;s methods and governance, say, but that conversation can&amp;#8217;t happen without talking about its actual workings, nor can it happen if it is casually lumped together with other, dissimilar kinds of group action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bigger of those two mistakes appears early: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &amp;#8220;The problem I am concerned with here is not the Wikipedia in itself. It&amp;#8217;s been criticized quite a lot, especially in the last year, but the Wikipedia is just one experiment that still has room to change and grow. [&amp;#8230;] No, the problem is in the way the Wikipedia has come to be regarded and used; how it&amp;#8217;s been elevated to such importance so quickly.&amp;#8221; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curiously, the ability of the real Wikipedia to adapt to new challenges is taken at face value. The criticism is then directed instead at people proclaiming Wikipedia as an avatar of a golden era of collective consciousness. Let us stipulate that people who use terms like hive mind to discuss Wikipedia and other social software are credulous at best, and that their pronouncements tend towards caricature. What &amp;#8220;Digital Maoism&amp;#8221; misses is that Wikipedia doesn&amp;#8217;t work the way those people say it does.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neither proponents nor detractors of hive mind rhetoric have much interesting to say about Wikipedia itself, because both groups ignore the details. As Fernanda Viegas&amp;#8217;s work shows, Wikipedia isn&amp;#8217;t an experiment in anonymous collectivist creation; it is a specific form of production, with its own bureaucratic logic and processes for maintaining editorial control. Indeed, though the public discussions of Wikipedia often focus on the &amp;#8216;everyone can edit&amp;#8217; notion, the truth of the matter is that a small group of participants design and enforce editorial policy through mechanisms like the Talk pages, lock protection, article inclusion voting, mailing lists, and so on. Furthermore, proposed edits are highly dependant on individual reputation — anonymous additions or alterations are subjected to a higher degree of both scrutiny and control, while the reputation of known contributors is publicly discussed on the Talk pages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wikipedia is best viewed as an engaged community that uses a large and growing number of regulatory mechanisms to manage a huge set of proposed edits. &amp;#8220;Digital Maoism&amp;#8221; specifically rejects that point of view, setting up a false contrast with open source projects like Linux, when in fact the motivations of contributors are much the same. With both systems, there are a huge number of casual contributors and a small number of dedicated maintainers, and in both systems part of the motivation comes from appreciation of knowledgeable peers rather than the general public. Contra Lanier, individual motivations in Wikipedia are not only alive and well, it would collapse without them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Digital Maoism&amp;#8221; argument is further muddied by the other systems dragged in for collectivist criticism. There&amp;#8217;s the inclusion of &lt;em&gt;American Idol&lt;/em&gt;, in which a popularity contest is faulted for privileging popularity. Well, yes, it would, wouldn&amp;#8217;t it, but the negative effects here don&amp;#8217;t come from some new form of collectivity, they come from voting, a tool of fairly ancient provenance. Decrying Idol&amp;#8217;s centrality is similarly misdirected. This season&amp;#8217;s final episode was viewed by roughly a fifth of the country. By way of contrast, the final episode of M*A*S*H was watched by &lt;em&gt;three fifths&lt;/em&gt; of the country. The centrality of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV, &lt;/span&gt;and indeed of any particular medium, has been in decline for three decades. If the pernicious new collectivism is relying on growing media concentration, we&amp;#8217;re safe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Popurls.com is similarly and oddly added to the argument, but there is in fact no meta-collectivity algorithm at work here — Popurls just an aggregation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS &lt;/span&gt;feeds. You might as well go after my.yahoo if that&amp;#8217;s the kind of thing that winds you up. And the ranking systems that are aggregated all display different content, suggesting real subtleties in the interplay of algorithm and audience, rather than a homogenizing hive mind at work. You wouldn&amp;#8217;t know it, though, to read the broad-brush criticism of Popurls here. And that is the missed opportunity of &amp;#8220;The Digital Maoism&amp;#8221;: there are things wrong with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS &lt;/span&gt;aggregators, ranking algorithms, group editing tools, and voting, things we should identify and try to fix. But the things wrong with voting aren&amp;#8217;t wrong with editing tools, and the things wrong with ranking algorithms aren&amp;#8217;t wrong with aggregators. To take the specific case of Wikipedia, the Seigenthaler/Kennedy debacle catalyzed both soul-searching and new controls to address the problems exposed, and the controls included, &lt;em&gt;inter alia&lt;/em&gt;, a greater focus on individual responsibility, the very factor &amp;#8220;Digital Maoism&amp;#8221; denies is at work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The changes we are discussing here are fundamental. The personal computer produced an incredible increase in the creative autonomy of the individual. The internet has made group forming ridiculously easy. Since social life involves a tension between individual freedom and group participation, the changes wrought by computers and networks are therefore in tension. To have a discussion about the plusses and minuses of various forms of group action, though, is going to require discussing the current tools and services as they exist, rather than discussing their caricatures or simply wishing that they would disappear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?a=aeLB1X"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?i=aeLB1X" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?a=lakQINE3"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?i=lakQINE3" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Many-to-many?g=34"/&gt;</summary>

Although they only used a fraction of our interview in the &lt;a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2006/myspace-0524.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt; Tech Talk&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to publish the extended version online.

      <title>News of Wikipedia's Death Greatly Exaggerated</title>
      <summary>Nicholas Carr has an odd piece up, reacting to the ongoing question of Wikipedia governance as if it is the &lt;a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/05/the_death_of_wi.php"&gt;death of Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. In Carr&amp;#8217;s view&lt;br /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; Where once we had a commitment to open democracy, we now have a commitment to &amp;#8220;making sure things are not excessively semi-protected.&amp;#8221; Where once we had a commune, we now have a gated community, &amp;#8220;policed&amp;#8221; by &amp;#8220;good editors.&amp;#8221; So let&amp;#8217;s pause and shed a tear for the old Wikipedia, the true Wikipedia. Rest in peace, dear child. You are now beyond the reach of vandals.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; Now this is odd because Carr has in the past cast entirely appropriate aspersions on &lt;a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2006/02/community_and_h.php"&gt;pure openess as a goal&lt;/a&gt;, noting, among other things, that &amp;#8220;The open source model is not a democratic model. It is the combination of community and hierarchy that makes it work. Community without hierarchy means mediocrity.&amp;#8221; &lt;p&gt;Carr was right earlier, and he is wrong now. Carr would like Wikipedia to have committed itself to openess at all costs, so that changes in the model are failure conditions. That isn&amp;#8217;t the case however; Wikipedia is committed to effectiveness, and one of the things it has found to be effective is openess, but where openess fails to provide the necessary defenses on it&amp;#8217;s own, they&amp;#8217;ll make changes to remain effective. The changes in Wikipedia do not represent the death of Wikipedia but adaptation, and more importantly, adaptation in exactly the direction Carr suggests will work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2003/10/02/ozzie_on_us_on_email.php"&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve said it here before&lt;/a&gt;: Openness allows for innovation. Innovation creates value. Value creates incentive. If that were all there was, it would be a virtuous circle, because the incentive would be to create more value. But incentive is value-neutral, so it also creates distortions &amp;#8212; free riders, attempts to protect value by stifling competition, and so on. And distortions threaten openess. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, successful open systems create the very conditions that require a threaten openess. Systems that handle this pressure effectively continue (Slashdot comments.) Systems that can&amp;#8217;t or don&amp;#8217;t find ways to balance openess and closedness &amp;#8212; to become semi-protected &amp;#8212; fail (Usenet.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A huge number of our current systems are hanging in the balance, because the more valuable a system, the greater the incentive for free-riding. Our largest and most spontaneous sources of conversation and collaboration are busily being retrofit with filters and logins and distributed ID systems, in an attempt to save some of what is good about openess while defending against Wiki spam, email spam, comment spam, splogs, and other attempts at free-riding. Wikipedia falls into that category.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And this is the possibility that Carr doesn&amp;#8217;t entertain, but is implicit in his earlier work &amp;#8212; this isn&amp;#8217;t happening because the Wikipedia model is a failure, it is happening because it is a success. Carr attempts to deflect this line of thought by using a lot of scare quotes around words like vandal, as if there were no distinction between contribution and vandalism, but this line of reasoning runs aground on the evidence of Wikipedia&amp;#8217;s increasing utility. If no one cared about Wikipedia, semi-protection would be pointless, but with Wikipedia being used as reference material in the Economist and the NY Times, the incentive for distortion is huge, and behavior that can be sensibly described as vandalism, outside scare quotes, is obvious to anyone watching Wikipedia. The rise of governance models is a reaction to the success that creates incentives to vandalism and other forms of attack or distortion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve also noted before that &lt;a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2005/08/12/governance_scaling_and_anonymity_in_wikipedia.php"&gt;governance is a certified Hard Problem&lt;/a&gt;. At the extremes, co-creation, openess, and scale are incompatible. Wikipedia’s principle advantage over other methods of putting together a body of knowledge is openess, and from the outside, it looks like Wikipedia’s guiding principle is &amp;#8220;Be as open as you can be; close down only where there is evidence that openess causes more harm than good; when this happens, reduce openess in the smallest increment possible, and see if that fixes the problem.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who build or manage large-scale social software form &lt;a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/03/etech_clay_shirky.html"&gt;the experimental wing of political philosophy&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; in the same way that the US Constitution is harder to change than local parking regulations, Wikipedia is moving towards a system where evidence of abuse generates anti-bodies, and those anti-bodies vary in form and rigidity depending on the nature and site of the threat. By responding to the threats caused by its growth, Wikipedia is moving the hierachy+community model that Carr favored earlier. His current stance &amp;#8212; that this change is killing the model of pure openess he loved &amp;#8212; is simply crocodile tears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?a=S4bFIC"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~a/Many-to-many?i=S4bFIC" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?a=78TsccC6"&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~f/Many-to-many?i=78TsccC6" border="0"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Many-to-many?g=32"/&gt;</summary>

      <id>http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2006/08/back_to_reality.html</id>&lt;p&gt;I had an on-camera audition yesterday, the first one in several months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was for a sitcom, and the material was sort of tough: it was essentially the same beat over and over again, and I had to come up with ways to make each beat different and entertaining (well, at least to myself.) It was surprisingly fun to prepare, especially when I found a beat that I figured most actors would use as a &amp;quot;throw away&amp;quot; line for an easy joke, that I made into a moment where I try to show the other guy exactly what he's missing, because I'm single and he's not. (When I did my brilliant beat that I was so proud of in the room, it was rewarded with that special type of laughter that's actually utter silence, so maybe I should have just gone for the easy joke.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it was a good experience. The people there were all friendly and warm, and they made me feel like they were happy to see me, which is quite a rarity in Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't think I'll get to go any further in the process, though, because I was at least six or seven years older than everyone else there, and I bungled one line, but at least I enjoyed myself, and since I'm not desperate for a job, I was able to relax and just do my thing; my goal was to have fun and at least enjoy creating and performing two pages of this character, and that's exactly what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything you need to know about where I am right now follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I told the guard what show I was there for, he said to me, &amp;quot;Do you know that you're supposed to park on the street?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I did not know that,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, they have you guys parking on the street,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;but I think I'll let you park over in that garage. Just drive past the reserved spots and take the first open one you find.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Really?&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;It's not a big deal for me to park on the street.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Don't worry about it,&amp;quot; he said, as he opened the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you,&amp;quot; I said, and realized that I was unconsciously going into my pocket to tip him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Damn you, Vegas. Just when I thought I was out . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2006/08/in_praise_of_th.html</id>&lt;p&gt;I didn't mention where I was staying in Vegas for obvious reasons, but I've wanted to sing the praises of &lt;a href="http://www.palms.com/"&gt;The Palms&lt;/a&gt; since the day I checked in. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The food is great, the rooms are huge and comfortable, the bed is second only to a luxury suite at the Bellagio, and their staff is simply the best I've ever encountered. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. Oh my god, the staff at the Palms is just incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every single person I encountered there, from the front desk to housekeeping to room service to the bartenders to the dealers in the poker room treated me like they were there specifically to take care of me, and I was the only person they were working for. It was just amazing. The outstanding service and amenities at the Palms will make you forget where you are, until you walk down into their casino (which is always swarming with beautiful twenty-somethings, if you're interested in that sort of thing) and remember that you're in Las Vegas. Their pool is fantastic (try the lobster club and get a bucket of Newcastles. Trust me on this one.) and on the weekends, it's a sexy party that would impress even the likes of&amp;nbsp; Stewie Griffin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't do much gaming while I was there, but I spent my entire last night in Vegas in their poker room (story to come,) and it was great, too. The dealers were awesome, and the manager even opened a table specifically for us -- and offered to keep it private -- when we asked to spread a 3-6 HORSE game after midnight in an otherwise-full room. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've always wanted to find "my hotel" to stay in when I go to Vegas, and over the last few years I've tried lots of different places in that quest. I'm happy to report that my quest has come to an end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2006/08/the_hum_of_the_.html</id>&lt;p&gt;During dinner tonight, my cell phone rang. Caller ID said &amp;quot;Restricted.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Male or female?&amp;quot; I said to Otis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Female for a buck,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I flipped open the phone. &amp;quot;Hello?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Wil, it's Ryan.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Ryan! Hold on a sec.&amp;quot; I turned the phone away from my face and looked at Otis. &amp;quot;Ship it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He grimaced and reached into his pocket as I won yet another prop bet from him. (I've played a tiny bit of poker while I've been here, and I'm probably stuck fifteen bucks total, plus the disaster of Martini-fueled blackjack on my birthday. If it wasn't for Otis spewing money to me on prop bets, I'd be &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; stuck. As it is, I'm even on the whole trip, and I may actually be a little bit ahead.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What's up?&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mom wanted me to call you and find out if it was okay for me to play &lt;em&gt;Vice City&lt;/em&gt;. I think it's okay, because I'm seventeen and everything, but mom said she wasn't sure and wanted me to talk to you about it since you've played it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan is an incredibly mature and responsible person. I know that he understands the difference between reality and video games, and I'm actually more concerned about the &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; he spends playing them, than the content of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;you're seventeen, so you're able to buy yourself tickets to rated 'R' movies, and &lt;em&gt;Vice City&lt;/em&gt; isn't any worse than, say, &lt;em&gt;Scarface&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Goodfellas&lt;/em&gt;, but hold on a second and let me think about it, okay?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put the phone to my chest, and explained the situation to the table. Oh, and now would be a good time to point out that we were in a *very* nice restaurant where I wouldn't take a call if we weren't way in the back, against the wall with no other diners around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Does he know that it's not okay to hit beat a hooker with a baseball bat and get his money back in real life?&amp;quot; My friend Ryan said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good question,&amp;quot; I said. I put the phone back to my ear and said, &amp;quot;I have to ask you one question: if you pick up a hooker in real life, is it okay to hit her with a baseball bat to get your money back after she gets out of your car?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, since hookers are empty shells and not real people,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;then yes. Yes. It's okay to whack her with a baseball bat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I relayed this to the table and added, &amp;quot;I think he's mature enough to handle &lt;em&gt;Vice City&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tell him that he he also has a future career in Hollywood,&amp;quot; Ryan said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2006/08/blame_it_on_the.html</id>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The thrill of victory, and the agony of defeat . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/08/wsop-main-event-rob-boilingfish.html"&gt;Rob &amp;quot;Boilingfish&amp;quot; Berryman Doubles Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I
looked at Rob's table, and saw that one of the chip leaders, William
Thorsson was there, as well as a few large stacks. I forgot to record
all the other details, because Rob got involved in a massive pot while
I was standing there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He raised under the gun, and Thorsson re-raised a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;. It was folded back to Rob, who&amp;nbsp; calmly pushed all of his chips into the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A photographer moved in next to me, blocking Rob's father's view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, give his dad some space, okay?&amp;quot; I said. He stepped back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All-in
on Table 151!&amp;quot; The dealer called out. ESPN cameras moved quickly into
action, as Thorsson went into the tank. He stayed there for close to
four minutes, and eventually called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My stomach flipped, my heart raced, and my hands got numb . . . just like whenever &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; have all my chips at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob turned up pocket tens, and Thorsson turned up . . . pocket nines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob
was a 90% favorite as the flop came out, all baby cards, but with two
hearts, putting a possible backdoor flush draw on the board for
Thorsson, who held the nine of hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turn was the hideous
two of hearts, and Rob's chances of winning dropped to just under 80%.
Even though the odds were in his favor, I've seen too many
heartbreaking suckouts send people I care about to the rail in the last
few days to feel any confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Come on,&amp;quot; I said quietly to myself, &amp;quot;put a black card out there, dealer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The
dealer waited for an eternity before rapping the table and burning a
card. He slowly pulled the last card off the top of the deck -- the
card that was going to double Rob up or send him back to Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a red card. My heart stopped. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;NO!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the four of diamonds. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;YES! YES! YES! YES!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob,
demonstrating a level of maturity and class that several players in the
room -- including one prominent young online player at his table -- could learn
from, nodded his head, and tapped the felt. William Thorsson, who
doubled him up, did the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My legs felt weak, and I put my hand on the rail to steady myself. Black dots flashed at the edges of my vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You're on camera,&amp;quot; my friend Joy said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don't care,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;My guy just doubled up!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dealer pushed Rob's stacks back to him, swept him the pot, then began counting out the rest of Thorsson's call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I
turned to his father, and shook his hand. What I really wanted to do
was hug him, but I'm pretty sure that shit doesn't fly down in Alabama.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/08/wsop-main-event-rob-boilingfish_07.html"&gt;Rob &amp;quot;Boilingfish&amp;quot; Berryman Finishes 33rd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One
of the chief tasks of the writer is to share his emotions with the
reader, so that the reader may be in the same place, emotionally as
well as physically, as the writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to be where I am right now, please stand up, and punch yourself in the stomach. Then, sit down, and do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob
&amp;quot;Boilingfish&amp;quot; Berryman was eliminated in 33rd place today, when he made
a championship move -- with his money ahead, no less -- against two
players who quite frankly had no business being in the hand. Hell, even
I know that, and I suck at poker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[. . .]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob was in the
big blind, David Einhorn had opened for 160K from middle position. William Thorsson called, and Rob called. The flop came Qs9c5c and Rob
checked. Einhorn bet 400K, Thorsson raised to 1.3M, and Rob
check-raised them both all-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einhorn thought for .00094
seconds, and called for his last 900K. Thorsson, who I guess took some
of my stupid pills this morning, went into the tank for almost five
minutes, and also called. ESPN's cameras swarmed around the table, and
everything else in the room slowed to bullet time while the dealer
counted out the main and side pots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob looked anxious to turn
over his cards. I turned to his dad and said, &amp;quot;He must have a set,
nines or queens. Thorsson must be on a flush draw, and maybe Einhorn
has aces or kings.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We waited for an age, then we waited for
another age while an ESPN cameraman loaded in a new tape (He politely
barked at the table, &amp;quot;Hey! Don't flip over your cards until I'm ready!&amp;quot;
Real classy, those ESPN guys.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we saw their cards: Rob
turned up 7c8c, for the straight flush draw, Einhorn showed AsQc for
top pair (brilliant!) and Thorsson showed . . . KsJs for the 22-1 longshot that he called getting 6-1 (genius!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Rob's slightly ahead,&amp;quot; I said to his dad, &amp;quot;and these other guys are morons for calling.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The
turn was the ace of hearts, and suddenly one of those morons seemed
pretty smart. You can start punching yourself in the stomach now, if
you'd like to follow along with me at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Come on, just one club. Just put one club out there,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;I'll never ask for anything again, I promise.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The
dealer knocked the table, and slid one card off the top of the deck
underneath the largest pile of poker chips I've ever seen in my life,
and I held my breath as the river card came off the top of the deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/08/wsop-main-event-rob-boilingfish_07.html"&gt;Read More&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;p&gt;I
talked with Rob and his dad after Rob had cashed out. After taxes and
things, he'll have over a quarter of a million dollars, yet he was the
same level-headed guy I'd talked to so many times over the last few
days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;To be honest with you,&amp;quot; he said to me, &amp;quot;I'm really
happy to be going home.&amp;quot; He turned to his dad and said, &amp;quot;Do you think
we can go home tonight?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wasn't petulant, he wasn't complaining, he just seemed tired, and eager to get back to his real life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don't think so,&amp;quot; his dad said, &amp;quot;we'll probably get out of here tomorrow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What's next for you?&amp;quot; I asked him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I just want to go fishing,&amp;quot; Rob told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though he easily could have been, I knew he wasn't talking about poker, and I was happy for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On
our way down the hallway to the media room, my friend &lt;a href="http://absinthetics.com/blog/"&gt;Ryan&lt;/a&gt; said, &amp;quot;You
know, he probably finished in exactly the right place for him. He has
enough money and success in this event to take care of college, and
he's got his head on right, so he'll invest it wisely. He'll be the &lt;em&gt;king&lt;/em&gt; of his home game, and he'll be able to walk down the street without anyone bugging him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan was right, of course, like he always is about anything involving poker. Maybe the poker gods really do know what they're doing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2006/08/there_is_no_sun.html</id>&lt;p&gt;It's real interesting to cover the World Series, especially the main event. We on Team blog get close to the action without ever being involved in a meaningful way, but we're close to those who are. When a player we've been following busts out, it's like losing a friend, and when a player who's a douche takes down a huge pot, we all grumble at how unfair the world is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the people who have shown up to cover the final few tables of the Main Event, the people we call &amp;quot;The fuckin' new kids.&amp;quot; We've been here for weeks (some of us, like &lt;a href="http://taopoker.blogspot.com/"&gt;Pauly&lt;/a&gt;, have been here for two months) which is nearly a year in Vegas time, and when one of these hotshots from some big organization swaggers into the room and starts barking orders at us, we get a little . . . cranky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Example: We had one new guy freak out at one of our friends and proclaim, &amp;quot;I was just covering the White House!&amp;quot; to which our friend replied, &amp;quot;And now you're here. Are you sure that's something you want to brag about?&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have our own shorthand language, we have our local eateries and watering holes, and most of all we've learned to lean on and support each other. We're all exhausted, but I will readily admit that when this is all over in a few days, I'm going to miss it. I will miss the camaraderie, and I will miss all those things we've done over the last few weeks to maintain our sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll miss seeing my friends every day, and I'll miss working with people who I deeply respect. But mostly, I will miss hustling Otis for piles of money in various prop bets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2006/08/can_you_be_wher.html</id>&lt;p&gt;Because of the media restrictions, which have been imposed partly to keep things under control in the Amazon room, but mostly because some media outlets opened their check books rather wide for exclusivity, it's increasingly difficult to get inside the tournament area and cover the action in anything resembling real-time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this has been annoying in many cases, it's actually forced us to get better stories, deeper stories, about the &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; behind the numbers and hand histories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My major assignment is to cover Team PokerStars players, but -- entirely by accident -- I stumbled upon my absolute favorite story of this kid named Rob &amp;quot;Boilingfish&amp;quot; Berryman. Rob is just over 21 years old, and was the last player to qualify in the &lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/07/wsop-pokerstars-150-wsop-seat.html"&gt;largest Main Event qualifier in history&lt;/a&gt;, which sent 234 players here a couple of weeks ago. Here's the story so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I paused near the center of the room on my way out, and a man in a PokerStars hat called out to me from the rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked over and he said, &amp;quot;would you write something on the blog about Steven Berryman?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;What's his name on PokerStars?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Boilingfish,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;He's got a lot of college buddies back home who know him as 'Rob.' They're watching him really closely and want to know how he's doing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You bet, sir.&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;I'll find out what I can, and report it for all of them. Oh, before I go are you . . .&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, I'm just his dad,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nobody is &lt;/em&gt;just&lt;em&gt; a dad, when they are as proud of their son as you are,&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I thought. I tried to say it, but the words caught in my throat. I've been there with my own kids before, and seeing the love and pride in this man's eyes put me right back in the bleachers for too many basketball, soccer, and baseball games to count. Man, I miss my boys.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was a couple of days ago, and since then I've been keeping a close eye on Rob, and talking with his dad, who watches him from the rail with such pride, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I looked for Rob just after the money bubble burst. Here's an excerpt from my post, &lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/08/wsop-main-event-beyond-bubble.html"&gt;Beyond the Bubble&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got up near Humberto's table, and stopped to check in on Rob &amp;quot;Boilingfish&amp;quot; Berryman, and I nearly panicked when I saw an empty seat where he was the last time I looked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bumped into my friend Joy, who is shooting some of the great pictures you're seeing with our posts, and asked her if they were breaking tables in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; she said, &amp;quot;I don't think so.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, [expletive deleted],&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;I was really hoping that --&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just then, Rob walked back to his seat. I hadn't even noticed that he had a healthy stack there. I guess when I saw the empty seat, they fell into some sort of panic-induced blind spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;-- this guy was still in!&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I extended my hand to him and introduced myself. &amp;quot;I'm the guy your dad asked to cover you on the blog,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He grinned sheepishly and said, &amp;quot;I think my dad's more excited than I am.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I'm a dad,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;and I totally understand how he feels. When he's watching you and wearing a PokerStars cap, I can see myself watching my kids play T-ball while I wear a Direct Tire T-shirt.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He turned over his shoulder, and saw his dad standing at the rail. He waved and turned back around. I watched his dad swell with pride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How are you doing?&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have about one hundred and five thousand,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is good,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, and I didn't even think I would be here today, because I was so sick last night.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nerves?&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh no,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;I think I ate some bad food or something, because I was up all night long.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh man,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;That sucks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, I finally had a doctor come in and give me a shot around six this morning, and even then I didn't think I'd make it here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at his stack together. &amp;quot;So this is pretty cool, considering.&amp;quot; He said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, I think I'll agree with you,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And did you know that I got here on sixteen dollars?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh yes,&amp;quot; I told him, and I didn't even try to suppress the huge smile that spread across my face. &amp;quot;We on Team Blog know all about you, and we're cheering like hell for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[. . .]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed the rail, and stopped to talk with Rob's father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Congratulations, dad!&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Did he tell you about being sick overnight?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;I'm really glad that he's here, though.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So am I,&amp;quot; he said. The pride in his eyes may have brought tears to mine.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot more in that post, so I encourage you to go ahead and read the full story at the Official PokerStars Blog. When you get back, keep reading from my post &lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/08/wsop-main-event-pause-in-action.html"&gt;A Pause in the Action&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my way down the hallway, I bumped into Rob &amp;quot;Boilingfish&amp;quot; Berryman and his dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How are you doing?&amp;quot; I asked him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have about 130K,&amp;quot; He said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You have just about 10K under average,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;you're doing great, man.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you think I should do?&amp;quot; He asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Dude,&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I thought, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I played like a moron and busted before level 2. You don't want my advice on &lt;/em&gt;anything&lt;em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You should just keep doing what you've been doing,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;because it's really working well for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;I think I have some respect at my table.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Use that, man,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;but don't forget that you have enough chips to go deep. How are you feeling?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I'm really tired.&amp;quot; He said. I could see the exhaustion in his body, but there was also a big tell that, as a parent, I recognized from times my own kids have been sick: his pupils were pretty dilated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Right after the money bubble, he told me, 'I don't think I can go on, dad,'&amp;quot; His dad told me, &amp;quot;and I told him, 'you got to! you got to keep going!'&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They both smiled, and Rob said, &amp;quot;Yeah, when we got past the twenty thousand mark, I felt a little extra motivation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That's entirely understandable,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, I think we're making something like three thousand an hour now, but I just want to finish the day and go to bed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That's a great plan,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;whatever happens, we're all really proud of you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked at the clock on his phone. &amp;quot;Oh! I have to get back in there,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just keep doing what you're doing!&amp;quot; I said as he joined the stream of players moving back into the tournament area.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he left, his dad told me that he really wanted to just get him back to the hotel and into bed, so he'd feel better for tomorrow, and he thanked me for covering his son on the blog. I told him that it was my pleasure. It was an understatement, but it's the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made one last foray into the tournament room about an hour ago, and I talked with Rob for a minute. He was exhausted, and seemed relieved to take a break and not worry about poker for a little bit. He leaned back in his chair while the other players at his table fought over the antes and blinds, and we talked about the tournament. I gave him updates on some of the other PokerStars players in the field, and a few of the big pros who are left in action. I looked up and saw his dad watching proudly from the rail, but I also saw the concern that a parent has when they know their kid &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; needs to get some rest. I don't know anything more about this father and son than you do if you've read this far, but I've heavily identified with them both, and it continues to be an honor to share their story with the Internets, which you may have heard is just a series of tubes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2006/08/the_moneys_pour.html</id>&lt;p&gt;When you live in Vegas for more than a couple weeks, you learn a few things about the city: how to avoid traffic on the strip, where to go for good &amp;quot;locals&amp;quot; food (Greg Raymer introduced me to a Thai restaurant that's just amazing) and lots of ways to avoid the tourists (which you used to be, until you figured out that you were, in fact, living here. Now you're a local, and you look forward to Wednesday because it's the one day each week when the goddamn tourists aren't swarming.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you won't expect to find, and in fact can't find if you're actually looking for them, are the wormholes. Allow me to quote &lt;a href="http://www.absinthetics.com/blog/2006/07/29/every-bad-idea-deserves-fudge-vol-ii/"&gt;Ryan&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wheaton is of the opinion that the Tilted Kilt contains an entrance to a wormhole. Enter that much-frequented establishment, order a beer, and suddenly it’s 8 in the morning and you’re standing outside your hotel with a growing sense that you have neither slept nor done anything remotely beneficial to your well-being in the time that’s passed. For a guy who grew up on Star Trek his grasp of physics is either extremely tenuous or cunningly warped; still, anecdotal evidence provides quite a bit of support to this theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were under the impression that the Kilt contained &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; wormhole, but it turns out that it is just &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; wormhole, one of many around the city. Some other wormhole entries and their exits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The food court at O'Shea's ends up at the Excalibur's poker room.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The All-American Bar and Grill ends up at The Gold Coast.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Bowling Alley at the Gold Coast ends up in front of the Palms.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Hooker Bar in the Rio is sort of a Russian Roulette, ending variously:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Boulder Highway in Henderson.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In the Bowling Alley at the Gold Coast (and points beyond.)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The UMC quickcare.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Binions.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All of the above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are others, I'm sure, but I've only experienced the Tilted Kilt's wormhole first hand. Okay, and the bowling alley. But that's it. I've only heard about the others from my writing colleagues here, and quite frankly, I'm not particularly anxious to confirm their existence firsthand, though I can regrettably admit that I haven't walked out of the Gold Coast once since I got here and thought, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Well, that was a good idea.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is the first day that the entire field is playing together at once, which is kind of cool.&lt;br /&gt;We all had the day off yesterday, while the players took time out between days two and three, and after I finished some Team PokerStars duties with the media, I ended up with many of my friends in the Caesar's poker room (which is really nice) playing a mixed game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait a minute,&amp;quot; I said, after we'd been playing for about two hours, &amp;quot;I just realized that I could have been floating in my pool all day, and instead I'm inside, &lt;em&gt;playing poker!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;You could always cash out and get out of here,&amp;quot; Otis said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No way. It's already six, and I'm pot-committed to hanging out with my friends.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to take a moment away from this story to note that Jay Greenspan, who is a hell of a nice guy, was playing in this game with us. Jay is in town to write a &lt;a href="http://www.fulltiltpoker.com/poker-blog/"&gt;blog for Full Tilt&lt;/a&gt;, and he has a new book out, called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312347839/wilwheatodotn-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hunting Fish&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jay,&amp;quot; I said to him during the game, &amp;quot;Didn't you write a book about losers?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wrote a memoir,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That's going on my blog, dude.&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished stuck about thirty bucks (which is sadly less than I ended up stuck after bowling the other night,) after I got quartered on a low in stud/8 on seventh street, but it was really fun. After we finished, Absinthe and I took Otis over to the gelato bar, because Otis has never had gelato, and we figured the odds of falling into a wormhole at the gelato bar were pretty small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought Otis a pistachio, and got myself a passion fruit with a vanilla Italian soda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is this together?&amp;quot; The girl said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;I'm buying this handsome man a gelato, because he is my date.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a wasted line. The girl didn't flinch, and Otis, blissfully enjoying his first foray into gelatoland, didn't tilt. So when you hear the latest rumor that I'm gay, you know where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otis was going to meet G-Vegas to play poker some more, and since Ryan was playing in the Main Event again today, he and I decided to leave Otis and the rest of the writers at Caesar's and go back to our hotels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cab line at Caesar's Palace (&amp;quot;Why did they build a palace for him, anyway?&amp;quot; I said earlier in the day, &amp;quot;It's not like he's ever going to use it.&amp;quot;) was offensively long, so Ryan and I decided to walk over to Bellagio and catch a ride there. We also stopped at Tiffany, because Anne's birthday is on Tuesday (and she's AFK until then, so I can safely say this -- and if any of her friends are reading and blow it, I'll punch you in the back of the head, the next time I see you) and I wanted to get her one of the new Frank Gehry rings. It is awesome, and it is squiggly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way out of Bellagio, we stopped by this giant chocolate fountain that I somehow didn't know existed until last night, and I marveled at this gorgeous model train display they have set up in the atrium area. &amp;quot;If I could do with stuff what I can sort of do with words,&amp;quot; I said to Ryan, &amp;quot;this is what I'd like to do.&amp;quot; I realized the audacity of this statement as soon as it passed my lips, but Ryan was too offended or polite to comment on it; a good friend, indeed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm on a fair amount of &amp;quot;fucking bullshit on the tournament floor&amp;quot; tilt, described by &lt;a href="http://www.antesup.com/blogs/blog/1"&gt;Tom Murphy&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.antesup.com/"&gt;Antes Up!&lt;/a&gt; thusly: &amp;quot;Welcome to the World Series of Assholes.&amp;quot; A few examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.absinthetics.com/blog/2006/08/04/mrs-lincoln-said-the-play-was-pretty-bad/"&gt;Ryan busted Chris Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly for all of us, he's flying below Cardplayer's radar, which needs to commit the space to covering Phil Hellmuth's antics.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Speaking of Hellmuth: What the hell is he even doing walking around the floor? The tournament people and ESPN[1] are going out of their way to treat those of us who have a legitimate reason to be there like complete shit. Hellmuth is not in the tournament any more, he's not media, and everywhere he goes he makes a scene. He is, in fact, getting in the way of people who are trying to do their goddamn jobs. A player actually had him taken out of the tournament area (correctly,) yet&amp;nbsp; Hellmuth is back in the room, really mugging for all the cameras. What a jopke.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Speaking of the cameras: what a bunch of assholes the ESPN[1] guys are. Seriously. I've been in the entertainment industry for a long time, and I don't think I've encountered a group of producers and cameramen who are bigger pricks. These guys shove people out of their way, apparently operate at the third grade level of basic manners and courtesy (I don't think I've heard a 'please' or 'thank you' or 'excuse me' from any of them the entire time I've been here) and seem to think that they're the only people here who have a job to do. I hear from other writers that it was just as bad last year, and we should expect it to get worse as we get closer to the final table. Yippee!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;All these media restrictions are being unevenly, inconsistently, and arbitrarily enforced. They should get their shit together, make a set of rules, and fucking stick to them. This &amp;quot;Hellmuth Exemption&amp;quot; is bullshit, even if it makes for good TV. Last time I checked, this was a poker tournament, not a reality TV show.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the not-on-tilt department, we've been writing some great stuff at the &lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/"&gt;official PokerStars blog&lt;/a&gt;. Here's a small sample:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/08/wsop-main-event-in-search-of-big-story.html"&gt;Looking for the Big Story (by Wil Wheaton)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;I walked up to table 142 (studiously avoiding the increasingly rude and inconsiderate ESPN camera crews) and looked for Humberto's trademark visor. It wasn't there, but evidence of Humberto's presence was: an absolutely epic stack of chips that is so large, the tournament staff may be thinking about racing off the pink chips sooner than planned. I looked down at them and started to count, just as Humberto appeared&lt;br /&gt;
back at his seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looked up at me and smiled, and I said, &amp;quot;So, uh, it looks like you've been playing a little poker, sir.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just a little bit,&amp;quot; he said with a grin and a shrug, as he sat into his seat during the deal. I pulled my notebook out of my pocket and wrote, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Brenes has a huge stack. Only one other stack is close, entire table looks glum.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glum? Really? Did I really write &amp;quot;glum?&amp;quot; I'll be sure to drop in a &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;swell&amp;quot; later on.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="The%20second%20break%20is%20now%20over%20and%20players%20are%20back%20at%20the%20tables.%20It%20was%20quite%20a%20roller%20coaster%20for%20Dmitri%20in%20the%20first%203%20hours%20of%20play.%20It%20seems%20like%20he%27s%20played%20about%2080%%20of%20the%20hands,%20at%20least%20that%27s%20how%20the%20rest%20of%20the%20table%20feels."&gt;Dmitri Nobles - Who is this guy? (by CJ Hoyt)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;The second break is now over and players are back at the tables. It was quite a roller coaster for Dmitri in the first 3 hours of play. It seems like he's played about 80% of the hands, at least that's how the rest of the table feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I've doubled up like 5 or 6 other players and I still have more than I started with,&amp;quot; he told me on his way out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he's right.&amp;nbsp; He's sitting at $553,000, which still puts him more than $100,000 ahead of second place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one big hand, he rivered a flush and got a guy to call after calling the clock. On another, he bet the whole way to the river where he caught a Queen, winning another nice pot. Hands like those have kept him going. We're approaching the money bubble now and Dmitri says he doesn't plan on changing his strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When we get close to the money, I'm going to steal every blind.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/08/wsop-main-event-tom-mcevoy-1983.html"&gt;Tom McEvoy: 1983 WSOP Champion, and 2006 Unsung Hero (by Dr. Pauly)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;Tom McEvoy begins Day 3 as one of three WSOP Champions left in the field. 2005 Champion Joe Hachem and 2000 Champion Carlos Mortensen are both still in the hunt for their second championship along with Tom McEvoy, who won his championship in 1983. That was before Jason Strasser [currently second&amp;nbsp; in chips] was even born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McEvoy has won four WSOP bracelets. He won bracelets in NL Hold'em, Limit Omaha, Limit and Hold'em Razz. He also made 17 final tables at the WSOP. McEvoy also won an even on the PPT. When he won the WSOP Championship in 1983, he beat out Poker Hall of Famers Doyle Brunson and Crandall Addington. He also only won $540,000. At that time, it was the highest payout for any poker tournament. Compare that to this year's payout distribution. 18th place at the 2006 WSOP will be guaranteed more money than McEvoy won in 1983. Times have changed at the WSOP with a huge influx of satellite winners.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also had a couple of cool stories in the last few days that I haven't had time to link:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/08/wsop-main-event-raymer-plays-like.html"&gt;Raymer Plays Like a Champion (by Wil Wheaton)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;A floorman brought a new player over to Greg's table, and sat him under the gun to Greg's left. The floorman said, &amp;quot;Oh, here you are, sir. A nice and easy table for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new guy had several racks of chips, and fired out a big raise before he could even get them all stacked up. It was folded around to Greg, who looked at his cards in&lt;br /&gt;
the small blind, thought for a second, and mucked. The big blind also folded, and the new guy flipped his pocket queens face up as the dealer shipped him the pot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pauly and I talked about Tom and Joe, both of whom are doing very well, and figured out how we're going to split up our duties today when I saw Greg glance our way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lifted my hand to wave, when I realized that he wasn't looking at us, but was looking at his wife, Cheryl, who was against the rail a little bit behind us. Greg smiled at her, and she smiled back. I was struck by how Greg can stay so cool under such pressure, and identified with Cheryl's concern (well, as much as I could, since I'm just Greg's friend, and not his, uh, wife.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg went back to his cards, and open-raised from the button. The small blind folded, and the big blind (the new guy) called. Greg put on his holographic glasses, and rested his chin on his hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ESPN crew stood up and started rolling. A few railbirds snapped pictures, and the rudest photographer I've ever seen in my life shoved his way between me and Pauly, then bumped the ESPN camera, then blocked someone who was already set up to take a photo. Good work, dude. On behalf of all the writers here, I'd like to applaud&lt;br /&gt;
your professionalism and courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flop came out: 8d-8h-2d. The new guy checked, and Greg checked behind. The As fell on the turn, and the new guy checked again. Greg bet 2000 into a pot that looked to be around 3000, and the new guy folded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;See?&amp;quot; Pauly said. &amp;quot;That's how he's been doing it all day. Just chipping away and picking up small pots.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like a champion.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/08/wsop-main-event-fossilman-does-his.html"&gt;Fossilman Does His Best (by Wil Wheaton)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;The tournament director announced that this was the last hand before the break, just as action came to Greg, who was once again on the button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greg looked at his cards, raised, and struck that now-familiar pose. It was folded to the big blind in seat two, who thought for a moment, and called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phil Gordon was the first player to talk to me about the &amp;quot;artificial bubbles&amp;quot; in tournaments. These are moments that come up just before breaks, when players are anxious to get out of their seats and grab a snack, go to the bathroom, or eat some Keno crayons. Good players know that they can steal on these artificial bubbles, so they're likely to make moves from late position with a very wide range of cards. I know that Greg is a brilliant competitor, and I know that, even though his stack is relatively short, he'll make this move because it's usually the correct thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the flop came out T-7-2 rainbow, the first thing I thought was, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&amp;quot;Hammer!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; The second thing I thought was, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&amp;quot;Oh man, I hope Greg has a hand.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big blind checked, and Greg thought for a moment. He counted out a bunch of pink chips, set them to the side of his stack, and looked at the other guy. Another moment passed, and Greg put a little over 7000 into the pot of almost 8000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other guy counted out a call, then picked up his hands and put them over his mouth. Everything about his body language said to me that he had some sort of hand, but he wasn't really crazy about it. He looked like he was trying to determine if Greg was putting a move on him, and my heart began to pound in my chest as if I was in the hand myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stayed in the tank for close to two minutes, and eventually mucked his cards. Greg smiled and flipped up two red kings.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ESPN[1] bullshit is really getting on my nerves, but we're just three players off the money bubble at the moment, so hopefully they'll lighten up a little bit once this dramatic television moment has passed. (I heard that ESPN[1] declared that the player who goes out on the bubble must stay in his or her seat until they can come over and film them. Can you fucking believe that? You go out on the bubble in the Main Event of the WSOP, and they expect you to sit there and wait for them to send over Captain Asshole and the Rudeboys to capture the moment? If I went out on the bubble, I'd tell ESPN[1] I'd sit in my seat . . . for $14,597. Jerks.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well. If if things get really annoying, we can always jump into a wormhole. I'm looking for one that ends up in my backyard, underneath the Chinese Elm with my wife, my dogs, and a glass of lemonade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[1] I have decided that ESPN stands for Extremely Something Pricks Needacockpunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2006/08/its_the_simple_.html</id>&lt;p&gt;Just before midnight, I packed up my laptop, cleaned up our desk, and told Pauly that I was going home for the night, so I could get back to work early tomorrow morning, instead of near 1 pm because I'm up until 3:30 writing, plus an hour to unwind when I get back to my hotel room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was grateful to not hear a single bad beat story on my way down the hallway, and when I opened the door to go out to the parking lot, I noticed that the air wasn't miserably hot for the first time since I got here three weeks ago. In fact, it was probably in the high 80s or low 90s, and it felt really good on my skin. I stopped for a second, and I thought, &lt;i&gt;"Man, this is one of those really simple things that just makes me smile."&lt;/i&gt; It instantly occurred to me that I was quoting Dirty Vegas in my head, and now I had a nice mental soundtrack to accompany me across the parking lot to my car, which was uncommonly far away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I passed the taxi and valet stands, and walked down the driveway toward my car. Five hundred yards or so into my journey, I neared a young couple at an idling car. She sat in the driver's seat, and looked up at him. He stood on the curb, hands folded across his chest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Ah,"&lt;/i&gt; I thought, &lt;i&gt;"It's a young couple having a fight in the parking lot."&lt;/i&gt; The normality of this put me at ease. I could have been in any suburban mall in America at that moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I passed them, I heard him say, "Well, what do you think I should have done?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked over at them, and saw that she was &lt;i&gt;pissed&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Andrew," she said, "You can't push with ace king after a raise and a re-raise, especially with big stacks yet to act behind you!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not be normal for the average young couple having a fight in the parking lot, but it is beyond normal at the World Series of Poker, which, I guess, makes it normal for me here right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He began to offer some defense, but I quickened my pace to avoid hearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"She's right,"&lt;/i&gt; I thought, as I skipped down the steps and jogged across lot C to my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>http://wilwheaton.typepad.com/wwdnbackup/2006/07/like_the_doodah.html</id>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Together, more or less in line, just keep truckin' on . . .&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt; -The Grateful Dead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;I talked with Anne late last night, just before I planned to leave the Rio and go back to my hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;The kids really miss you,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I really miss them, too,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Ryan told me that all he wants for his birthday is to come out and see you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was all it took. Tears filled my eyes and fell in huge drops down to the marble floor beneath my aching feet as my heart broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We know that they can't come out, because the kids are still in summer school, so I composed myself and talked with both of them on the phone for a few minutes. After I hung up, I saw my friend and fellow PokerStars blogger Otis walking out of the media room. I really didn't want to be alone just then, so I invited myself along to follow him outside, where we engaged in a nightly ritual that I call &amp;quot;talking each other off the ledge.&amp;quot; It's a good talk, and all the writers have it at least twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we talked, we headed back into the Amazon room together, and I found the best story I wrote all day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/07/wsop-main-event-meeting-bati99-while.html"&gt;Meeting bati99, while Fossilman and Pokertrip Build their Stacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We traded the ninety-four degrees of hot pavement in front of the poker kitchen for the quiet din of the tournament room, and noticed that they are &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; running satellites for Main Event entries. The cash games, while on fewer tables, are still taking up at least a quarter of the room though many tables are empty. (I note this because I thought that the entire room had been transitioned over to Main Event tournament play. Oops.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our way down the rail, as we got dangerously close to table 20 and my post traumatic stress disorder that was certain to ensue, we hung a quick right at table 40, where a couple of PokerStars players were seated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the players looked up at us, and said, &amp;quot;Hey! Are you guys with the PokerStars blog?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, sir, we are,&amp;quot; Otis said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When are you going to come by and put us on it?&amp;quot; He said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know about Otis, but even though I know lots of people are reading our work, all the six digit stats in the world pale in comparison to the one guy who sees us walking past his table, and interrupts his play because what we do matters to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[. . .]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few more tables into the room, we found ourselves next to Greg. He appeared to have more chips than his current count online, but he was in a hand -- cool fossilman glasses on and everything -- when we walked up, so we left him alone and continued to prowl the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few steps later, I saw that Greg's wife, Cheryl, was standing by the rail with her sister, so I zagged when Otis zigged, and walked over to talk with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It looks like Greg has about 7500 or so,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He just texted me a few minutes ago,&amp;quot; Cheryl said, &amp;quot;and he's up just over ten thousand.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh? That's great!&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;I'm supposed to be covering him today, but I don't want to get too close while he's playing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, you should just go over and talk with him. He likes you and it wouldn't bother him at all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't tell her that I'm convinced that if I walk too close to Greg, one of his opponents will pull an Aaron Kanter on him because I happened to be there. This is an entirely rational thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[. . .]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security goons began sweeping out the room, and I walked with Cheryl, her sister and her sister's husband, until we got to the intersection of Main Street and &lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/07/el-juego-insano.html"&gt;Wil Wheaton Kicks Ass Drive&lt;/a&gt;. They went down WWKAD, and continued down Main toward the hallway and media room, glancing at tables my whole way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got to table 153, I saw Jon &amp;quot;pokertrip&amp;quot; Friedberg in seat 2, facing the rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His hands obscured his chipstack, but I noticed that &lt;a href="http://www.pokerstarsblog.com/2006/07/what-long-strange-pokertrip-its-been.html"&gt;he was wearing his bracelet&lt;/a&gt;, which made me very happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched a couple of hands, holding security at bay with my press badge, and Jon looked up and saw me. He smiled and waved, and I waved back. I looked at his chips and made the international face for &amp;quot;how many chips do you have? I don't want to walk over the rail and bother you while you're playing, and the stupid media rules prohibit me from explicitly asking you. Besides, you probably know and can just hold up a few fingers for me and make everyone happy while keeping us on the right side of the rules.&amp;quot; This motion was accomplished by cocking my head to the right, and arching my left eyebrow. Yes, we actors can convey a lot in the most subtle of motions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He held up his two index fingers, indicating eleven thousand. His huge smile indicated that he was very happy to have that stack in front of him.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking through the room and finding and writing those stories, also gave me my mojo back:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last 48 hours, I've felt like a complete failure, and I really haven't liked it. After walking the floor with Otis, seeing Greg, talking with Cheryl and checking up on Jon, I feel like a writer again. I don't believe it's a coincidence that I don't feel like throwing up for the first time since Friday, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time I think about picking up a deck of cards and some chips, I think I'll reach for my notebook and pen, instead.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This morning, my friend John Vorhaus called me and invited me to play in a charity poker tournament that would air on Live at the Bike. Against my better judgment I agreed, and found myself in a one-table SNG with &lt;a href="http://www.gavinlive.com/"&gt;Gavin Smith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.barrygreenstein.com/joepoker.htm"&gt;Joe Sebok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.lizlieu.net/"&gt;Liz Lieu&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://www.sunnyleone.com/"&gt;pornstar&lt;/a&gt; (NSFW), &lt;a href="http://www.vorza.com/poker.htm"&gt;jv&lt;/a&gt;, and a few online sharks. Yes, I was the dead money, and yes I busted first when I lost a race with AQ to The Gavin's 77. Yes, I was outlasted by a pornstar. No, it's not the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after I got set up in the media room, &lt;a href="http://craigsjournal.pokerworks.com/"&gt;Michael Craig&lt;/a&gt; called me, because he was with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Brodie"&gt;Richard Brodie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.tiltboys.com/blog/2006/07/rafe-wins-bracelet.html"&gt;Rafe Furst&lt;/a&gt;, both of whom wanted to say hello. Richard and I have been trying to meet in person for a long time, and Rafe and I know each other from the BARGE list, but have never actually met in real life. I talked with them for a few minutes, then I got to listen in as Rafe taught Mike basic roshambo strategy for a book that Mike is writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about twenty minutes, &lt;a href="http://www.andybloch.com/gl/pub/index.php"&gt;Andy Bloch&lt;/a&gt; came over, and they all headed upstairs to Richard's suite to work on a tournament PLO chapter for the book. I really wanted to go along, just to hang out and learn about poker (also, I really like Andy and Rafe; I suspect that Richard and I would get along very well, too, if given the chance) but I felt a responsibility to get back to the media room and work on some stories. The big one today is Joe Hachem: his battle to defend his bracelet begins today, and of course he's at the featured table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Las Vegas is equal parts Nirvana and Tenth Circle of Hell, and every day I visit both places several times. Right now? I'm on my way to the good place; at this very moment, Pauly, CJ, Otis and I are recreating Edgar Winters' Frankenstein by drumming on the table, humming and grunting, and making wah wah noises. I love the &lt;em&gt;esprit du corps&lt;/em&gt; we have on Team Blog; it reminds me of the camaraderie we had at ACME during the &lt;em&gt;Love Machine&lt;/em&gt; show, and that's a feeling that leads to great work. I'm really proud and happy to be part of this team. Like I said yesterday, we're poker's Voltron.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Selling Sprint Short</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt; If I owned any stock in Sprint-Nextel, I'd sell it. I just spent 60 minutes on the phone resolving a billing issue. It's too complext to explain in detail, but suffice it to say that Sprint's billing system wasn't up to the task of the change their sales office made on one of my accounts and, as a result, they got a costly support call. 20 minutes of that call was spent by the support rep, who was very nice, and his supervisor hand calculating my bills. If they get calls like this on just a small percentage of their bills, they're eating all their profit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This small example underscores for me the importance of properly working IT infrastructure for any business that doesn't have money to burn. It's easy to make the decision to not spend the money on IT and then wonder later why support costs are so high. It's hard to connect the two and even harder to spend the necessary money later when the pain starts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/infrastructure" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/customersupport" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; customersupport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/sprint" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; sprint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Forget the Frontal Lobe</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt; In June, I reported that I was &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2006/06/yelling_at_moir"&gt;disappointed that a podcast from Moira Gunn was so short&lt;/a&gt;. The interview was with Katrina Firlik about her book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400063205/windleyofente-20"&gt;Another Day in the Frontal Lobe&lt;/a&gt;. The interview had several fascinating stories that left me wanting more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So, I bought the book. I was disappointed again. The book was mostly about medical school and the rigors of residency. Fine stuff if you're interested in that, but I was looking for more stories about the brain and how it works. They're there, but it wasn't what I was expecting. My advice: listen to the IT Conversations &lt;a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1082.html"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;. It's cheaper and faster. Can't beat that! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/itconversations" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; itconversations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/medicine" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/technation" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; technation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Podcast Transcripts Via CastingWords</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt; Jon Udell is &lt;a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/08/15.html#a1506"&gt;transcribing his podcasts&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="http://castingwords.com/"&gt;CastingWords&lt;/a&gt;. (Also see Jon's &lt;a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/05/08.html#a1444"&gt;earlier review of the service&lt;/a&gt;.) His bill? $260 for 620 minutes of audio. That's darn cheap. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Jon reports that the results are surprisingly accurate, but he edits them to make people read better than they sound and to make them more readable. This process takes an hour or so per episode--almost one-to-one on a time scale. Of course Jon's also spent time editing the audio for the podcast as well. That's a considerable time investment, but the results show quality. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Why do this? One answer is that Google indexes written text, not audio, so getting search placement requires text. Another reason is that some people simply prefer to read instead of listen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Doug Kaye used to create transcripts of IT Conversations shows back when it was mostly interviews he was doing. He stopped, mostly because of the cost, I think. We create fairly extensive landing pages for shows that should contain significant textual content to help Google index the shows correctly. Still, there's no way you can completely capture the multiple twists and turns of a standard show in a page of text. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/itconversations" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; itconversations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/podcasting" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; podcasting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/search" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>$100 Laptop Design is Firming Up</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt; Wired magazine has an &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.08/laptop.html"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; on the design for the &lt;a href="http://laptop.org/"&gt;$100 laptop&lt;/a&gt;. The latest concept has &lt;a href="http://www.laptop.org/OLPC_files/orange-rotate.jpg"&gt;lost the crank&lt;/a&gt; for power and has cute little ears that flip up to provide antennae and flip down to cover ports. I covered &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2006/02/alan_kay_the_10"&gt;Alan Kaye's presentation on the $100 laptop&lt;/a&gt; at the Univ. of Utah last February. In addition, IT Conversations has &lt;a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail777.html"&gt;audio of a talk on the $100 laptop&lt;/a&gt; by Nicholas Negroponte from PopTech! 2005. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/laptops" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; laptops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Making Public Data Public</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt; The form that public data takes is important to me. When governments make data available in the right way, it can be reused--mashed up--by others to create new eGovernment applications that governments don't have the time, interest, or money to create. I wrote about &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2002/07/enabling_web_se.shtml"&gt;enabling Web services&lt;/a&gt; through the use of open standards when I was Utah's CIO (here's a &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/docs/EnablingWebServices.pdf"&gt;longer paper&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While my discussion has mainly focused on the technical side of this, there are also important public policy issues. What data &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be public, for example. Most governments have a freedom of information act, but this goes beyond that in some ways. What are the test cases and legislation around the country that touch on making public data publicly available online. If anyone is familiar with an expert who can speak to the legal and policy aspects of this important area, I'd like to be introduced. Please &lt;a href="http://xri.net/=windley"&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; directly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/publicdata" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; publicdata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/egovernment" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; egovernment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/webservices" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; webservices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>OS X Keyboard Preferences Get Lost</title>

As shown in the screenshot, I regularly make my CapsLock key into a control key. As an emacs user, that's much better for me. I was very glad when Apple added this as part of the OS. But about one out of three times OS X loses my preference at reboot. This doesn't happen with other preferences, so why this one? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/osx" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; osx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/emacs" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; emacs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Identity Open Space and DIDW Event: Register Now!</title>
      <summary>&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/events/iiw2006b/announcement.shtml"&gt;&lt;img src="/events/iiw2006b/iiw_2006_small.png" align="right" border="0" hspace="3" vspace="3"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt; We're doing an &lt;a href="http://ios.windley.com/wiki/IOSSantaClara"&gt;identity open space&lt;/a&gt; on Monday Sept. 11, 2006 in Santa Clara in conjunction with Digital ID World. DIDW starts Monday afternoon and we're going to do 3/4's of a day of open space beforehand to talk about user-centric identity. The format will be largely the same as the &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/iiw2006"&gt;Internet Identity Workshops&lt;/a&gt; that we've been having--just shorter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you're coming to DIDW or just in the Bay Area, we'd love to see you there. You can expect good discussion and meetings with people at the fore-front of this emerging area. If you're coming to DIDW and have wondered what all this user-centric identity is about, this is a great way to get up to speed before the conference. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We've put together a &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/events/didw_ios/register"&gt;registration page&lt;/a&gt; for the event. There's a nominal $25 fee to cover the cost of lunch. DIDW is graciously covering the cost of the room and refreshments. They're also offering a discount on the regular DIDW registration fee to IOS participants--$995. &lt;a href="http://www.didwexpo.com/live/41/TB588112"&gt;Register for DIDW here&lt;/a&gt; and use the code H1101 to get the discount. Both DIDW and our open space event will happen at the &lt;a href="http://www.didwexpo.com/live/41/TB588112//SN723776"&gt;Santa Clara Marriott&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We'll be holding a &lt;a href="http://iiw.windley.com/wiki/Workshop2006b"&gt;second installment of the Internet Identity Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, called IIW 2006b Dec 4-6 at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA. You can see a &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/events/iiw2006b/announcement"&gt;workshop announcement&lt;/a&gt;, get information about &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/events/iiw2006b/hotels"&gt;hotels&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/events/iiw2006b/register"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; for that event now. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/identity" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; identity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/iiw2006" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; iiw2006&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/conferences" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; conferences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Atom as a Case Study Redux</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt; I just finished listening to &lt;a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1155.html"&gt;Tim Bray's talk on Atom&lt;/a&gt; from ETech. Yeah, I'm behind on listening to IT Conversations--still catching up from vacation. This is an excellent talk for anyone interested in standards, RSS, or Atom. I also went back and read my &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2006/03/tim_bray_on_ato"&gt;original notes from the talk&lt;/a&gt; (I heard it live too). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It's interesting to me that even when I've heard a talk live and blogged it, going back on IT Conversations and listening to it again gives me fresh information. I think it's about context--I hear it now in the context of everything that happened since March and what I'm working on now, so it has new meaning. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/itconversations" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; itconversations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/atom" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; atom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/rss" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; rss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/timbray" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; timbray&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Undistinguished Identity and Reputation</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt; I just posted an article on &lt;a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=3474"&gt;undistinguished identity and reputation&lt;/a&gt; at Between the Lines. People typically don't want their online activities correlated, but reputation is largely built from such correlations. Understanding and coming to terms with the tension between those two facts is going to be a large part of building reputation systems that work. The principles of reputation that Kevin Tew, Devlin Daley, and I discuss in our &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/essays/2006/dim2006/framework_for_building_reputation_systems"&gt;paper describing our reputation framework&lt;/a&gt; are aimed at lessening that tension. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/reputation" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; reputation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/identity" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; identity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/privacy" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; privacy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Management By the Identity Method</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt; While he's been on vacation, Joel Spolsky has been airing a set of pre-recorded posts on &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/07.html"&gt;three management methods&lt;/a&gt; which he calls &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/08.html"&gt;Command and Control&lt;/a&gt; management, &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/09.html"&gt;Econ 101&lt;/a&gt; management, and the &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/08/10.html"&gt;Identity Method&lt;/a&gt; of management, not to be confused with managing identities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;table align="right"&gt;&lt;tr valign="top"&gt;&lt;td width="137"&gt;&lt;div class="inlineimage"&gt;&lt;a href="http://photos.windley.com/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=imall&amp;id=Steve_cooking"&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos.windley.com/albums/imall/Steve_cooking.thumb.jpg" width="137" height="150" border="0" alt="Steve cooking" title="Steve cooking dead cow" name="photo_j"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Steve cooking dead cow&lt;br/&gt;(click to enlarge)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt; Joel saved the method he recommends, identity management, for last, spending the first few days shooting holes in Command and Control and Econ 101 as management methods. There's nothing here that you haven't read somewhere before, but Joel has a great way of writing and he's speaking about what's worked for him--that's always good. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At iMall, we tried very hard to practice the identity method. We called it "building a culture." Joel's spot on with this one: to practice the identity method, to build culture, you have to spend time together in places besides meetings. We catered a lot of meals. Once a month of so, we had a big BBQ that we called "dead cow." We had an annual hike up Timpanogos. We still have an annual golfing event. These activities were very popular and provided a place for people to bond. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One thing that Joel didn't mention that I think is important: nomenclature. Cultures have their own way of looking at things and their own way of talking about things. I'm not just talking about technical nomenclature either--we made up words and sayings for everything. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;table align="right"&gt;&lt;tr valign="top"&gt;&lt;td width="150"&gt;&lt;div class="inlineimage"&gt;&lt;a href="http://photos.windley.com/gallery/view_photo.php?set_albumName=imall&amp;id=The_Group_3"&gt;&lt;img src="http://photos.windley.com/albums/imall/The_Group_3.thumb.jpg" width="150" height="90" border="0" alt="Imallians climbing Timp (9/11/99)" title="iMallians climbing Timp (9/11/99)" name="photo_j"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;iMallians climbing Timp (9/11/99)&lt;br/&gt;(click to enlarge)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt; We succumbed at times to the temptation to practice Econ 101 management. While I believe there's a place for economic incentive, we found that throwing money or options at developers didn't really make them work harder or better. You're better off making people financially well off (to the extent you can) and then leaving the subject alone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For the identity method to work, employees have to be comfortable arguing with the boss and the boss has to be comfortable with that. As Joel says, if you give people information and then discuss the ramifications of actions with them, the group will typically come to a good decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That's why I think blogging is a good addition to the identity method. Building culture requires sharing information, but not just dry facts. More than simply sharing information, the identity method requires transparency in most areas. Blogs are a great way to lay the ground work for that. They're not sufficient, however--you still need to build relationships and have face-to-face discussions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I say "most areas" in the preceding paragraph, because there are places where a good manager protects the team. A good manager buffers uncertainty and ambiguity. Nothing is more cruel than complete honesty, particularly when it's ill timed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Joel describes the Command and Control method as "military" and while that's certainly the popular perception, it wasn't my experience. I spent 14 years in the Navy and had very few Command and Control encounters. Certainly the overall organization is very hierarchical, but the inter-unit interactions tend to be more identity method. The petty officers and chiefs knew a lot more about any given situation than I did and they were willing to share that with me and tell me where I was mistaken. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Moving from iMall to the State of Utah was a lesson in cultural disconnects for me, although I didn't really realize what was happening at the time. Governments are Command and Control organizations and smart people who've worked in them their whole lives are generally cynical and distrustful. I didn't get them and they didn't get me. It made for some unhappy times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Command and Control organizations even have rules that keep you from building culture. Things like rules against buying employees food, except in prescribed situations, come to mind. The identity method requires the organization to trust management in ways that large organizations aren't comfortable with. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I'm in complete agreement with Joel on the efficacy of the identity method, especially for managing developers and other smart people. Not only does it work, but it's a lot more fun. The funnest period of my working life was the time we were building iMall and most of that is because of the people who were involved and the relationships we built. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/management" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Elias Torres on SPARQL</title>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="http://assets.gigavox.com/showimages/1162.jpg" border="0" hspace="3" vspace="3" align="right" /&gt; I just published an &lt;a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail1162.html"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; I did with &lt;a href="http://torrez.us/"&gt;Elias Torres&lt;/a&gt; on SPARQL and the semantic Web at IT Conversations. This is part of my &lt;a href="http://www.itconversations.com/series/technometria.html"&gt;personal podcast&lt;/a&gt; that I call Technometria to couple it to this blog. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rohit Khare introduced to me to Elias while we were all touring the castle in Edinburgh while at &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/www2006"&gt;WWW2006&lt;/a&gt; in May. I started talking with him about SPARQL and immediately knew I wanted to know more about it and that he was the right guy to explain it. I think you'll find his interview interesting whether or not you're a fan of the semantic Web. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/itconversations" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; itconversations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/sparql" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; sparql&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/web" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/www2006" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; www2006&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/podcasting" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; podcasting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

Listeners who just download the podcasts won't notice much difference, but the Web site has been redone with a new look. Behind the scenes, the software we use to manage the site has also changed--I've spent the last few days getting reoriented. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; More significantly, &lt;a href="http://www.gigavox.com/"&gt;GigaVox Media&lt;/a&gt;, IT Conversation's new parent company launched with two new channels in addition to ITC: &lt;a href="http://osc.gigavox.com/"&gt;Open Source Conversations&lt;/a&gt;, run by Scott Mace, and &lt;a href="http://pa.gigavox.com/"&gt;Podcast Academy&lt;/a&gt;. We &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2006/06/the_conversations_keeps_evolving"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; this move in June--now it's reality. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You won't notice much difference in content at IT Conversations, we're still committed to bringing you high quality tech content from your favorite conferences and podcasts. We've got several new conferences and series coming online in the next little while and I think you'll enjoy them. We've just started releasing &lt;a href="http://www.itconversations.com/series/supernova.html"&gt;shows from Supernova 2006&lt;/a&gt;, for example and there's more on the way. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Personal listening queues and recommendations still work the same, as does show rating. You'll probably need to log in again since it's being hosted on a new machine with a new domain, but once you do that you'll find the old familiar interface. Please take the time to login and rate the shows you enjoy so we know what you like. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Thanks for listening... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/itconversations" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; itconversations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/gigavox" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; gigavox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/podcasting" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; podcasting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

This would be a great car to drive. The best quote from the video: "anyone who wants to know what a car should be should drive one of these." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The reason I mention it here, however, is that the Atom is built by a &lt;a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/less_car_the_ariel_atom.php"&gt;small team of seven people&lt;/a&gt;. It's easy to see how a small team can develop software, but the conventional wisdom is that to manufacture something like a car you &lt;em&gt;have to have&lt;/em&gt; a big organization. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I chose the word "manufacture" deliberately in the last paragraph because this isn't a one-off racing car, which are built by small teams, but a car you can order and buy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Manufacturing something like a car requires intense specialization of skills. So, how is the Atom possible? It still requires lots of specialization, but in the same way that a small programming team outsources a lot of specialization by using open source tools or buying hosted Web services, the Ariel team has outsourced things like building the engine (it uses a Toyota engine). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a theme that Thomas Malone talks about in his book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591391253/windleyofente-20"&gt;The Future of Work&lt;/a&gt;. He gave a talk recently at Accelerating Change 2005 that you can &lt;a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail731.html"&gt;listen to on IT Conversations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: &lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/itconversations" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; itconversations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.windley.com/tags/programming" rel="tag, nofollow"&gt; programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

      <title>Webvisions 2006</title>
      <link>http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2006/07/24/webvisions.html</link>
      <summary>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve returned from Portland, successfully capping off the little &lt;a href="http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2006/07/17/tour.html"&gt;Summer Tour&lt;/a&gt;. It feels really good to be back, save for the immediate dive into a pile of work. I had a great time at &lt;a href="http://webvisionsevent.com"&gt;Webvisions&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; my first time attending the conference (and the state of Oregon). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a fun event, and one that feels more intimate despite the full schedule over several tracks. I left feeling like I missed a lot in terms of the panels and presentations, but am looking forward to the podcasts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My own presentation went well, I think. It was early on Day 2 (8:30am), but the turnout was excellent, and I felt &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; more relaxed this time around. For those that attended, the &lt;a href="http://simplebits.com/publications/speak/webvisions/bpwd-wv2006.pdf"&gt;Bulletproof Web Design slides&lt;/a&gt; are available (18MB &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;). They are slightly cryptic without the commentary, but possibly interesting if you&amp;#8217;re feeling adventurous. Thanks to those that came out and listened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://webvisionsevent.com/schedule/detail/?evtloc=design_panel"&gt;The Design Panel&lt;/a&gt; (the actual title, which I love) went well, too, in lieu of myself being a bit drained after the morning&amp;#8217;s session. There was a great turnout, many of whom brought interesting questions. For instance, after talking about the importance of good copy (a rareity) as interface design, one attendee pimped her own copywriting business (multiple times). Now normally this would be bad practice &amp;#8212; but she managed to pull it off humorously. &lt;a href="http://avalonstar.com/"&gt;Bryan Veloso&lt;/a&gt; did a bang-up job as moderator (excellent meeting him for the first time) and &lt;a href="http://mikeindustries.com/"&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://7nights.com/asterisk/"&gt;Keith&lt;/a&gt; were spot on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with any post-conference rambling, you&amp;#8217;ll often hear that the social aspect is just as (or more) important than the program. Very true for Webvisions as well, where it was fun to meet many folks that I hadn&amp;#8217;t met before. And it being a smaller conference, that gave way for more time to chat in-depth on things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Non-Webvisions highlights of visiting Portland included:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The amazing &lt;a href="http://www.japanesegarden.com/"&gt;Japanese Garden&lt;/a&gt; (with a free bonus &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simplebitsdan/195907482/"&gt;view of the city and Mt. Hood&lt;/a&gt;). I was really blown away by it, and the location way up in a rolling hill above the city gave more of a hint at Oregon&amp;#8217;s landscape.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://stumptowncoffee.com/"&gt;Stumptown Coffee&lt;/a&gt;. I had the best mocha I&amp;#8217;ve ever tasted here, complete with &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simplebitsdan/195907634/"&gt;marked foam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dougfirlounge.com/"&gt;The Doug Fir Lounge&lt;/a&gt;. Like a pancake house that was turned ultra-hip and cool by the use of giant fir logs, fur-lined walls and crystal moose heads.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simplebitsdan/195904858"&gt;Greek Cuisina&lt;/a&gt;. This is where the wrap-up party was, and I&amp;#8217;ll let the photographic (and probably videographic) evidence speak for itself. Crazy place.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;More photos of Portland (and mostly the Japanese Garden) are over at &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simplebitsdan/sets/72157594208424816/"&gt;my Flickr stream&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.hotpepper.com/"&gt;Brad Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://nickfinck.com/"&gt;Nick Finck&lt;/a&gt; for the invite &amp;#8212; they and the rest of the team put on a great show.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;Since all these people care about is money, lets examine Facebook as a case study and&lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;follow the money.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lets set the stage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;Friendster&lt;/strong&gt; are looking like idiots - they blew their lead, never did show us &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;where&amp;#8217;s the money&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; and they&amp;#8217;re threatening us all with lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://myspace.com/"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; breaks 100M and Fox has shown that they&amp;#8217;re willing to share the profits with their TV affiliates, create anesthetized channels (for advertisers) and they&amp;#8217;e venturing into side businesses like video sharing, mobile platforms, record labels and - eventually - TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://bebo.com/"&gt;Bebo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is coming on strong - and is the latest darling to turn down huge buyout offers - BTW built with practically just one engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- all sorts of &lt;a href="http://multiply.com"&gt;mid-tier players&lt;/a&gt; are starting to flex their muscles - and show the variants on these models. Dating, travel, sports, cars, dogs, baby boomers, mothers, families - you name it - they&amp;#8217;ll be players.  And you know what?  Only the profitable will survive. Unless their idiot VCs wanna keep funding them. You can never stop that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://start.aimpages.com/"&gt;AIMPages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (AOL), &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://us.cyworld.com/"&gt;Cyworld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://spaces.live.com/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are lurking in the woods, and so is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/12945717/"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- lets mot leave out my friends at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://360.yahoo.com/"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - either!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2006/08/15/facebook-developers-launches-facebook-opening-up/"&gt;Tagworld&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.frappr.com/c/user/createamap"&gt;Frappr&lt;/a&gt; - where are THEIR open APIs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- and &lt;a href="http://web.tickle.com/"&gt;perenial&lt;/a&gt; players, like all &lt;a href="http://www.match.com/"&gt;sorts of dating sites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://classmates.com/"&gt;classmates oriented sites&lt;/a&gt;.  Even &lt;a href="http://www.netflix.com/FriendPage?lnkctr=mhbfri"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NetFlix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.joga.com/GLogin.aspx?done=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.joga.com%2F"&gt;Nike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; have social network nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- there&amp;#8217;s a new social network being announced just about every day now.  Which means that they&amp;#8217;ll be 1,000s of these things soon enough, and 10,000s of these things once &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://peopleaggregator.net"&gt;PeopleAggregator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; gets rolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- all inter-connected by open APIs and open standards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/08/open-letter-to-mary-hodder"&gt;remember my new schtick&lt;/a&gt; - before there are open standards - there need to be clear examples of end-user benefits - for all to see.  When something &lt;a href="http://developers.facebook.com/"&gt;this new&lt;/a&gt; becomes reality, its imperative to have early great examples (like Flickr.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 15 hours after &lt;a href="http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/08/woe-stop-the-presses-facebook-opens-up"&gt;finding out this news&lt;/a&gt; - here&amp;#8217;s what we got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;- you need a Facebook login to get access to the API keys (&lt;a href="http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/08/woe-stop-the-presses-facebook-opens-up#comment-80195"&gt;sorry Dave&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- the keys to the API are tied to an I.P. address&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- it was &lt;a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/"&gt;Chris Messina&lt;/a&gt; who gave me the poop - being the seed of the scoop. Lord knows wher ehe got it from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/OmMalik/~3/13096176/  "&gt;Liz Gannes is reporting that&lt;/a&gt; Facebook is limiting requests to 100,000 per hour for web apps and five per second per user of desktop apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we don&amp;#8217;t know (as of yet):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;- will the &amp;#8216;friends&amp;#8217; access expose an email to those people - so we can auto-register folks when they&amp;#8217;re imported into a system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- do they provide an &amp;#8216;opt-in&amp;#8217; for folks - to let THEM control if their email is moved around by others or not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- how robust (in general) are these APIs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- what the terms are for commecial exploitation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of &lt;span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Verdana"&gt;precedents &lt;/span&gt;for these kind of APIs (Amazon, eBay) and plenty of interest in using them.  This will make the &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2006/04/19/feeding-the-myspace-beast/"&gt;ad hoc eco-system&lt;/a&gt; marketplace &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2006/07/28/myspace-layouts-now-9th-biggest-search-term/"&gt;that&amp;#8217;s been growing up around MySpace&lt;/a&gt; look pathetic if they do it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which will EXACTLY implement the strategy Facebook has been executing - which is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;- take their position of strength with colllege kids&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- and branch out to enterprise and business licensing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- build up their OWN ecosystem, based upon open APIs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- now watch as their college kids migrate out of school and spread the good cheer at their new jobs - thereby shifting Facebook from college kid oriented to &amp;#8216;entrenched in enterprise&amp;#8217; - brilliant!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san&amp;#038;s=46854&amp;#038;Nid=22550&amp;#038;p=348517"&gt;Notice they have a deal with Chase for exclusive credit cards for their &amp;#8216;kids&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/30/facebook-to-add-1000-corporate-networks-tuesday/"&gt;Rumor has it that 1,000 corporations have been using Facebook.&lt;/a&gt;  Open APIs are essential to that strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2006/08/15/facebook-developers-launches-facebook-opening-up/"&gt;Pete Cashmore is calling for MySpace APIs&lt;/a&gt;.  Me too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2006/08/16/facebook-opens-apis-for-mashups/"&gt;Jeremy Owyang says&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;if done correctly, these APIs could replace many stale corporate intranets (esp if folks have to rely on a centralized group to update content) and it could tie to other tools such as linkedin, events, calendars, contacts, etc. Think about the rich profile information an employee could put on their Facebook account that could show the skills, projects, they’ve completed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now watch Facebook print money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All because they opened up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="http://theinternetispeople.com/2006/08/16/facebook-opens-its-api/"&gt;Ben Werdmuller puts it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;.opening an API is the ultimate in involving users in your community. By doing this, you allow them to help you build it - and because an API allows tools to be produced to interface with your existing features, you also allow your users to use your site in the way that best suits them. From usage patterns and direct feedback you can derive what you’re doing wrong, and improve accordingly. But more to the point, because users are now a part of your infrastructure, they will evangelise and promote your community of their own accord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take THAT you closed minded bigots!  I predict that &lt;a href="http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/08/vox7-hosted-experience-business-model"&gt;even mighty SixApart will open up their APIs&lt;/a&gt; and get this train a rolling.  With &lt;a href="http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/08/rafats-deal-report"&gt;all these deals humming along&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#8217;m hoiping that being OPEN becomes a requirement, instead of an anomaly, and that nobody funds anything UNLESS they&amp;#8217;re open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll look back on all this one day. and find that Aug. 15, 2006 was a pivotal moment.  Thanks again Mark!

&lt;p&gt;Facebook is now offering open APIs for people, friends, hptos and events!  Can life get any better than that!  Think of all the coolio things that can get done now!  Legally - without any mishigas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full 6-12 months ahead of schedule Facebook has - in a single blow - broken open this whole game.  Now the race begins to build out services and applications (even content) around these APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone wish to guess on how long it&amp;#8217;ll take MySpace and Bebo to respond?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img hspace="8" src="http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/facebook-dev.jpg" align="right" /&gt;Now I hate to say I told you so - but&amp;#8230;..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve had a fantastic couple of years flying around the world - getting paid to educate, rant and rave.  I clients seem to appreciate what I have to say, as many of them resign us up or come back later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I sense that this fall and winter things will be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sense that I&amp;#8217;ll be in LaLa and NYC allot more often, doing deals - shipping social networks.  I sense this is the year that BBM will grow, and I&amp;#8217;ll finally have to stop doing everything myself.  We&amp;#8217;ve found this fantastic product manager - her name is Maura Sparks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re all pretty acquainted with our various picadillos and we&amp;#8217;re starting to crank out code on a pretty regular basis now.  Our new license is going through its final stages (thanks Curtis and Jaemin!) and we&amp;#8217;ll soon be able to announce our first few deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re averaging over one serious call - a day now - so that means its time for a sales force.  Now gee - how can I find ONLY the best bodies out there - who want to help change the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yah - I know - I&amp;#8217;ll blog it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do NOT expect anything normal if you come to work for BBM.  Sure we got a product which gets bought by customers - but that&amp;#8217;s about where it ends.  We HAVE to protect our customers - and their customers - whether they like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to say &amp;#8220;the client has every right to be as stupid as they wish&amp;#8221; - but that&amp;#8217;s about to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember one day (back in 1987) Entertainment Tonight came knocking at our door - asking if we had anything to do with creating this softcore porno interactive game.  It was created with VideoWorks II. It was called Virtual Valerie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to explain to them the difference between a tool and the content created by that tool - but they would hear nothing of it.  And neither would my first wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re faced with the same predicament when selling social networks.  They need to be operated in a safe, socially concious, respectable and responsible manner - and we&amp;#8217;re not gonna tolerate any abuse of that responsibility.  We&amp;#8217;ve got clauses in our contract insisting upon the right of the end-user - and to the rights to own their own attention info (for instance.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This contract will be available at a site called PayAsYouGo.org - for free - for anyone who also wants to sell their code this way.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s all little bug fixes and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s the last new rev until a major new rev - which I&amp;#8217;m excited as hell about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much so that I&amp;#8217;m creating this post - just to jump for joy and embrace live at it&amp;#8217;s fullest. If everythng goes according to plan we&amp;#8217;ll have accomplished a major turn of the crank in less than two months since initial shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That ain&amp;#8217;t bad - right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;- ship code&lt;br /&gt;
- party&lt;br /&gt;
- listen to criticisms&lt;br /&gt;
- instantiate weekly global Skype conferences&lt;br /&gt;
- fix bugs&lt;br /&gt;
- decide how to make it better&lt;br /&gt;
- fix more bugs&lt;br /&gt;
- do the changes&lt;br /&gt;
- test them&lt;br /&gt;
- ship minor upgrade&lt;br /&gt;
- oh, did I forget to say - line up some customers&lt;br /&gt;
- fix more bugs&lt;br /&gt;
- get contract ready to sign (the &amp;#8216;PayasyouGo.org&amp;#8217; domain lined up as well)&lt;br /&gt;
- test some more, tweak the changes&lt;br /&gt;
- keep releasing minor bug changes&lt;br /&gt;
- fix some MORE bugs&lt;br /&gt;
- ship that puppy - major upgrade&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call it V 1.1 - Phil insists on calling it V 00.00.02
&lt;/p&gt;

We were Dodger fans too. I was eight years old when the Dodgers won the series in 1955, and remember it as a great triumph for the ordinary people of New York and New Jersey (where our family lived). Not just because they won at all, but because they beat the Yankees, the biggest overdog in sports.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="18"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;The Dodgers were truly loved. When they left two years later for Los Angeles, it was worse than a heartbreak for millions of fans. It was the beginning of the Money Era in professional sports. Until then, money played a role, but players &amp;#151; even Yankees like Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris &amp;#151; were ordinary guys, who happened to have extraordinary talent. Some lived in nice houses, but not many were sequestered in gated communities; and none played for the immense sums that go to the best players in the most popular sports today.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="18"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;True, few pros played only for the love of the game, even then. But in the pie chart of motivations, there was nothing like today's imbalance between love and money.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="18"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;The Dodgers left for money. When they did, they broke the heart of a city. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="18"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;Yes, the Giants left for San Francisco around the same time; but somehow that didn't hurt as bad, maybe because everybody knew the Polo Grounds was a wierd field for baseball from the start. And San Francisco wasn't a big money town then. It was a seaport like Brooklyn, with a similar wild mix of local ethnicities. Plus, Candlestick Park, the Giants' new home, didn't require the destruction of a village, as did the Dodgers move to &lt;a href="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/chavezravine/"&gt;Chavez Ravine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="18"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;The Dodgers went Hollywood, and the rest of sports followed.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="18"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;Like Dave, and the rest of non-Yankee New York, I became a big &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Stengel#Casey.27s_Amazin.27_Mets"&gt;Mets&lt;/a&gt; fan when the team came along, with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Stengel"&gt;Casey Stengel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/t/thronma01.shtml"&gt;Marv Thornberry&lt;/a&gt; (about whom Casey said "Can't anybody here play this game?"). New York's heart was mended by the Mets, who, like the Dodgers, embodied &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/2000/10/09.html"&gt;a philosophy&lt;/a&gt;. It was a huge triumph for the city and that philosophy when the Mets won the series in 1969. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="18"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;But money had already infected the game, just like it would infect the rest of the major professional sports.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="18"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;There will always be love. But money has been beating love, at least in professional sports, since 1957.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="18"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;Re-read the whole thing&lt;a name="rereadTheWholeThing"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2006/08/16#rereadTheWholeThing" title="Permanent link to 'Re-read the whole thing' in archive."&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/leftArrow.gif" height="9" width="11" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="18"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;a href="http://gesturelab.com/?p=14"&gt;Steve Gillmor&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="36"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;i&gt;...Just as Engadget's 7 million page views offers a vision of the micromedia, so too does it presage the microglut that arrives within minutes of that success. How do we deal with increasingly alert-driven streams to maintain discoverability, context, and a sense of empowerment. Systems that fail that test will be discarded as quickly as I am flushed out of Rojo and into&#138; what?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="36"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;i&gt;...the ahead-of-the-curve proposition becomes increasingly valuable. Watch Calacanis, the lightning rod. Watch Mernit, the synthesist. Watch the micromemes emerge from the boredom and ennui of the RSS rush hour.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="36"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;&lt;i&gt;...We have the control, and we know it. No amount of slime or power politics will stop this. As Doc says, we're still throwing tea into Boston Harbor 200+ years later. And if you're not with us, get the hell out of the way. We wish you no ill will &amp;#151; well, nothing significant &amp;#151; but don't get between the mama bear and her cubs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="18"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;font color="black"&gt;Those are just a few excerpts. Steve was headed to &lt;a href="http://www.digitalhollywood.com/BuildingBlocks.html"&gt;Digital Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;, and it shows.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</summary>

      <link>http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/2006/07/20.html#a1069</link>
      <summary>&lt;b&gt;This blog is &lt;a href="http://www.wordyard.com"&gt;moving.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Almost exactly four years ago, on July 22, 2002, I started &lt;a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/"&gt;my first blog&lt;/a&gt;. Blogging felt natural to me since I'd been writing for the Web since 1994 and self-publishing since 1974 (originally via mimeograph). My blog was part of a larger blogging program I'd put together at Salon, in partnership with Userland. It was the tech-downturn doldrums -- an era when every time we at Salon opened the papers or fired up our browsers we knew that someone, somewhere, would be predicting our imminent demise. And there wasn't a lot of extra cash at the company at the time, so the blogs program was chiefly a labor of love, launched in the wee hours. I did the CSS, wrangling Salon's home-page design into Radio Userland templates, all by myself (which anyone who knows anything about CSS can probably tell with a single glance at the unruly code). I loved Radio Userland at the time for the way it combined a blog publishing system and an RSS reader. But times change; Userland put its energy into other products; Salon Blogs produced many great blogs but not a substantial change in Salon's business; and my blog settled down from the program's focal point to a personal-publishing bullhorn. Several months ago, in anticipation of Salon's plan to build a new platform for users to contribute their own writing, we closed off new signups to the old Salon Blogs platform. Today I'm moving my own blog to a new home, &lt;a href="http://www.wordyard.com"&gt;here, at Wordyard&lt;/a&gt;. I've managed to export my whole four years' worth of archives (over 1000 posts, averaging about one per weekday for the whole timespan) to Wordpress. (For those who care, I used the Radio Userland exporter, which pops out a plaintext file in Movable Type export format; edited that file to make things like titles and categories work; then imported into Wordpress.) The comments, alas, will remain back at the original Salon Blogs location, where they will continue to be available. With this move, I plan to blog somewhat more vigorously, and to provide more posts about my forthcoming book, &lt;a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com"&gt;Dreaming in Code&lt;/a&gt;, as its January 2007 publish date nears. I also look forward to leveraging some of the great features and plugins created by the Wordpress open-source community. If you subscribe to my RSS feed in &lt;a href="http://www.bloglines.com"&gt;Bloglines&lt;/a&gt; (the reader I've been using daily for years), the transition should be transparent -- Bloglines will do the flip for you, you don't need to touch anything. If you subscribe through other feed readers or services, you'll have to resubscribe to the new feed address, which is &lt;a href="http://wordyard.com/feed/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. More anon!</summary>

      <title>Stem cells: Bush's shameful first veto?</title>
      <link>http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/2006/07/19.html#a1068</link>
      <summary>President Bush appears poised for the first veto of his presidency. The cause that has finally pushed him to reject Congressional legislation? An attempt to expand funding for stem cell research that Bush hobbled back in 2001. For millions of Americans, the potential fruits of stem cell research -- in the form of cures to dangerous diseases -- are a serious matter with grave personal import. For President Bush, the issue has always served as a political football. On the one hand, Bush argues that the destruction of human embryos (microscopic organisms made up of a few cells) is a kind of killing. His press spokesman, Tony Snow, adopting the supercharged cant of anti-abortion activists, &lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2006/07/18/bush_stem_cells/index.html"&gt;referred to it recently as "murder."&lt;/a&gt; In order to stop such "murder," Bush agreed in 2001 to limit all federal funding of stem cell research to a handful of pre-existing "lines" of cells -- cells that had been created specifically for research. His argument was, let's not use tax dollars to pay for the destruction of more embryos for the sake of research. Here is why Bush's position is a joke: &lt;i&gt;Thousands and thousands of embryos are destroyed every year in fertility clinics.&lt;/i&gt; They are created in petri dishes as part of fertility treatments like IVF; then they are discarded. If Bush and his administration truly believe that destroying an embryo is a kind of murder, they shouldn't be wasting their time arguing about research funding: They should immediately shut down every fertility clinic in the country, arrest the doctors and staff who operate them, and charge all the wannabe parents who have been wantonly slaughtering legions of the unborn. But of course they'll never do such a thing. (Nor, to be absolutely clear, do I think they should.) Bush could not care less about this issue except as far as it helps burnish his pro-life credentials among his "base." This has been true since the first airing of Bush's position in 2001, &lt;a href="http://archive.salon.com/politics/feature/2001/08/10/stem_cell/index.html"&gt;as I said back then&lt;/a&gt;. So he finds a purely symbolic way of taking a stand, but won't follow the logic of his position to the place where it might cause him any political harm -- as opposing the family-building dreams of millions of middle-class Americans would doubtless do. (And please don't test our credulity with the laughable "Go ahead and do the research, but let's not spend taxpayers' money on things they don't believe in" argument: If that had any bearing, my tax dollars would not be funding a war that 2/3 of the country opposes now that the specious arguments used to launch it have collapsed.) If Bush believes destroying embryos is murder, let him take a real stand against it. If he doesn't, he shouldn't make it harder for the thousands of embryos that are being discarded anyway to be used for a valuable purpose that could improve real lives. That's why Bush's stem cell position isn't Solomonic -- it's craven. His upcoming veto is an act not of moral leadership but of hypocrisy. And the cost of this hypocrisy, assuming Congress can't muster the votes for an override, will be borne by everyone who dreams of new cures for awful illnesses.</summary>

      <title>Sonic middle age: Everybody's happy nowadays</title>
      <link>http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/2006/07/13.html#a1067</link>
      <summary>I'm knocked out, stunned, by the new Sonic Youth album, &lt;i&gt;Rather Ripped.&lt;/i&gt; I'm not one of the band's cultists. Over the years, from the mid-'80s on, I'd hear, from friends who were, that I was missing out: They'd tell me that whatever their latest album was -- "Daydream Nation"! "Goo"! -- it was &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; album that would persuade me to join their ranks. I'd listen, feel respect for the legendary New York art-noise band's work, but never feel like coming back for more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I've been out of the Sonic Youth orbit for a while. Maybe I missed some transformation or evolution; "Rather Ripped" is incredibly seductive -- just melodic enough to engage you, just experimental enough to keep you hitting "repeat." The guitars shimmer with lanky Lou Reed/Feelies lines; the lyrics are &lt;i&gt;entirely audible&lt;/i&gt;; the incredibly tight rhythm section could do this in their sleep, but they're wide awake. There is a fundamental joy working its way out in this music, in a fully audible way. I am hooked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other musical events, &lt;a href="http://www.mountain-goats.com/"&gt;the Mountain Goats&lt;/a&gt; are slated to release a &lt;a href="http://www.beggars.com/us/themountaingoats/"&gt;new album&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Get Lonely,&lt;/i&gt; next month. But if you are impatient, there is an &lt;a href="http://www.4ad.com/releases/babylon-springs-ep-0/"&gt;EP from their Australian tour&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;i&gt;Babylon Springs&lt;/i&gt; that is also a fine piece of work. If some of the chord sequences sound a tad familiar, the full-band arrangements are sparkling, the lyrics sharp, the feelings painfully intense. &lt;!-- ckey="5DA439DC" --&gt;</summary>

      <title>Mashup Camp 2</title>
      <link>http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/2006/07/13.html#a1066</link>
      <summary>Yesterday I spent the day at &lt;a href="http://www.mashupcamp.com"&gt;Mashup Camp 2&lt;/a&gt;. I missed the first one last winter, but what I read intrigued me enough to make a point of showing up when it came around again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two relevant things here, one having to do with mashups, the other with that word "camp," which is really a proxy for the whole "unconference" movement of which this event is a high-profile example in the tech world. (Mashup Camp organizer &lt;a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=2621"&gt;David Berlind wrote about the first event's experience with the format&lt;/a&gt; back in February.) Let's start with that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I showed up at 9 a.m. down in Mountain View, at the &lt;a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/"&gt;Computer History Museum&lt;/a&gt;, the conference had no schedule -- just an open grid on an eight-foot-long pad at the front of the meeting hall. An hour later, several dozen developers (and some "API providers," a k a vendors or company reps) had introduced themselves, proposed sessions, posted the sessions on the grid, and presto, there it was, a conference schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/57/188905512_e14d78a77b_m.jpg" alt="Mashup Camp instant schedule grid" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There had been no arguments over process, no disputes, no grandstanding or boring throat-clearing. Part of that was the result of deft moderation by &lt;a href="http://www.kaliyasblogs.net/Iwoman/"&gt;Kaliya Hamlin&lt;/a&gt; (she writes about the event &lt;a href="http://kaliyasblogs.net/unconference/?p=36"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;); part, no doubt, was the nature of the attendees -- this was primarily an engineering conclave, after all. If we'd been talking about Iraq, something tells me the process might have been bumpier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the pop culture world, "mashup" means creating a new work by combining elements of two (or more) existing works. (Danger Mouse's &lt;a href="http://www.illegal-art.org/audio/grey.html"&gt;"Grey Album"&lt;/a&gt; -- the Beatles' White Album meets Jay-Z's Black Album -- is probably the highest-profile example in music to date.) In software, a mashup is a new program or service created by wiring up two or more existing programs or services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Web-services mashups can be remarkably easy to hack together and provide immediately gratifying results -- the canonical example was the &lt;a href="http://www.housingmaps.com/"&gt;Craigslist/GoogleMaps mashup&lt;/a&gt; that Paul Rademacher made last year, placing the Craigslist for-rent ads on Google's map service. At Mashup Camp, developers got the opportunity to show off their projects during a "Speed Geeking" event (modeled on speed dating) at which visitors in groups of a half-dozen wandered from table to table to hear five-minute demos. Here's a &lt;a href="http://wiki.mashupcamp.com/index.php/SpeedGeeking2"&gt;full list&lt;/a&gt; of the participating demo-ers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn't come away with the sense that any one of the projects I saw was going to change the universe. But put it all together and you got a window onto a simpler, faster, and perhaps smarter approach to software product development -- one that trades in the virtue of from-the-ground-up consistency and thoroughness for the even more compelling virtue of "getting something working fast." It's software development as a Darwinian ocean in which large numbers of small projects are launched into the water. Only a handful will make it to land. But most of them required so little investment that the casualty rate is nothing to lose sleep over.</summary>

      <title>Fallows, PIMs and Chandler</title>
      <link>http://blogs.salon.com/0000014/2006/07/11.html#a1064</link>
      <summary>&lt;a href="http://www.jamesfallows.com/"&gt;James Fallows&lt;/a&gt; has been writing thoughtfully about computer software for longer than most of us have been using it. Years ago he wrote a definitive paean (long online &lt;a href="http://www.yclipse.com/fallows.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but apparently no longer) to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Agenda"&gt;Lotus Agenda&lt;/a&gt;, Mitch Kapor's legendary personal information manager. (I say "a" rather than "the" because this program evoked such loyalty from smart writers it actually ended up with &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; definitive paeans; the &lt;a href="http://guterman.com/guterman_clips/guterman_clips_Agenda/guterman_clips_agenda.html"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; was by Jimmy Guterman.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the new issue of the Atlantic, Fallows writes about two latter-day PIMs -- Microsoft's OneNote and &lt;a href="http://chandler.osafoundation.org"&gt;Chandler&lt;/a&gt;, the long-gestating project of Kapor's Open Source Applications Foundation, the tale of which forms the central narrative of my book, &lt;i&gt;Dreaming in Code.&lt;/i&gt; He interviewed me for the article; though most of our conversation wound up on the cutting-room floor, I did make it into one paragraph. I wish the article were online (there's a &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200607/mind-meld"&gt;stub here&lt;/a&gt;, but the full piece is only accessible to subscribers). But I couldn't ask for a better venue for my first distant-early-warning book publicity. Here's the relevant graph:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td width="60"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Despite substantial follow-up grants from foundations and universities, the team developing Chandler has so far released only a partly functional calendar application. Scott Rosenberg, of Salon magazine, became an "embedded journalist" on the Chandler project from 2003 to 2005 in order to investigate why good software is so hard to make. (His book about Chandler and complex software design, Dreaming in Code, will be published in November [now, January]). "It is taking a long time, but anyone who writes off Chandler is being short-sighted," he told me. "They are on a quest." &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fallows asked me whether I thought the book had turned out to be a comedy or a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Neither," I replied, thinking furiously on my feet, my brain flashing back to my decade as a theater and movie critic. "It's an epic!"</summary>

Senior executives, marketing and communications professionals and knowledge workers can all save time and work smarter by harnessing the power of RSS. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;"Asia is clearly a burgeoning Internet market and Japan has quickly embraced blogging and RSS technology, so it was natural for us to extend our leadership position in North America to that segment," said Sandy Hamilton, executive vice president of NewsGator Technologies. "By partnering with another market leader in GMO Internet Group, we expect to quickly penetrate the Japanese business community, allowing companies to take advantage of a localized RSS platform that improves information dissemination and consumption." &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;"NewsGator is the clear leader in RSS aggregation and we wanted to take advantage of their technology and market expertise to deliver a solution that meets the unique needs of Japanese corporations," said Masatoshi Kumagai, CEO of GMO Internet Group, a subsidiary of multi-billion dollar GMO Group. "Although in its infancy, RSS in the enterprise is quickly gaining traction in North America because of its ability to help companies better control and take advantage of Internet-based information and content.

      <title>Spencer Stuart Selects NewsGator’s Enterprise RSS Solution to Improve Relevant Information Delivery</title>

      <summary>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;FONT size=1&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Leading Executive Search Consulting Firm Implements NewsGator Enterprise Server to Improve Search Consultant Productivity&lt;/EM&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;FONT size=1&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Denver, CO – June 5, 2006 –&lt;/STRONG&gt; NewsGator Technologies, Inc., the leading RSS platform company, today announced that Spencer Stuart, one of the country’s largest and oldest executive search firms, has deployed NewsGator Enterprise Server (NGES) to improve the way its employees find and share information. The product enables its consultants and other employees to automatically track relevant information about clients, executives and industries they serve.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;Through NGES, Spencer Stuart employees can access content from both internal (enterprise applications and repositories) and external (news and blogs) sources through NewsGator Enterprise Server and have it delivered through Microsoft Outlook® clients and Microsoft Sharepoint® portals. Later this year, the firm plans to automatically subscribe its search consultants and associates to all of the relevant RSS feeds they need regarding a company, its executives and news in the industry and have them be delivered directly to a folder in Microsoft Outlook. This will allow employees to receive the most relevant information they need to do their jobs without having to understand RSS.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;"Delivering relevant, timely information in an easy-to-consume way is a challenge in most enterprises, but RSS is a great way to solve this problem," said Trapper Markelz, senior project manager at Spencer Stuart. "NewsGator’s product allows users to gather this information in an easy, manageable way." &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;"In today’s business environment, accessing content from a growing number of different sources can be an overwhelming and inefficient process," said A.V.

"NewsGator was the only company offering a full-featured, server-based aggregator that could live behind the firewall."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;About NewsGator Enterprise Server&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;NewsGator Enterprise Server is a revolutionary new product for aggregating, reading and distributing RSS content within the enterprise.

      <title>NewsGator Technologies Releases New Version of Premier Platform for Enterprise RSS Management</title>
      <link>http://www.newsgator.com/news/archive.aspx?post=97</link>
      <summary>&lt;FONT size=2&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;NewsGator Enterprise Server 1.3 Helps Companies Improve Aggregation and Distribution of Relevant Information &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial&gt;&lt;FONT size=1&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Denver, CO – May 30, 2006 –&lt;/STRONG&gt; NewsGator Technologies, Inc., the leading RSS platform company, today announced the release of NewsGator Enterprise Server (NGES) 1.3, the latest version of its market-leading enterprise RSS aggregation and distribution platform. Since its initial introduction in October 2005, ten Fortune 100 companies as well as several market leaders in various industries have embraced NGES to streamline the process of information delivery within their organizations, increase employee productivity and discover untapped knowledge.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;A behind-the-firewall, enterprise-class offering, NGES provides organizations with the most complete and flexible platform for finding, distributing and sharing only the most relevant RSS feeds across groups and organizations. With NGES, employees can access internal and external RSS feeds within Microsoft Outlook, the full range of mobile devices, corporate portals, and the Web without having to download any client-side software. Enhancements within NGES 1.3 include improvements in usability, integration with Microsoft Sharepoint, new collaboration capabilities, additional knowledge management and administrative features, and globalization.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;"A key business issue facing enterprises today is finding the most effective way to manage the information flow of both external and internal content across their organization," said Robert McCullough, program manager, business applications and commerce, Yankee Group. "RSS has emerged as a viable platform for CIOs and CKOs to provide employees with relevant information and collaboration tools, which can directly impact efficiency and improve productivity. NewsGator Enterprise Server helps enterprises become more efficient by centrally managing subscriptions, deploying across platforms without installing client software, and minimizing bandwidth usage." &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;As companies and employees struggle with information overload, RSS has quickly become a powerful business tool to help them gain control over how content is managed and distributed throughout the organization. Access to accurate and relevant information is critical to making the right business decisions and communicating with customers in a timely manner. Companies in several industries, including pharmaceutical, retail, legal, consulting, human resources, financial services and public relations have dramatically improved employee productivity by deploying NewsGator’s enterprise-focused RSS solutions. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;"A lot of valuable, timely information gets lost in email," said Elizabeth Ellis, partner and Chief Knowledge Officer at Toronto based law firm Goodman and Carr, LLP. "With NewsGator Enterprise Server, practice groups can easily see relevant feeds from blogs, news and internal systems on our Microsoft Sharepoint Portal. It allows the attorneys and paralegals to find information more quickly, which will lead to more billable hours and better client service."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;"With the rapid growth of both internal and external feeds, companies are quickly realizing that the management and distribution of that content should be handled on a centralized basis," said J.B. Holston, president and CEO of NewsGator. "By working closely with customers since the initial unveiling of NewsGator Enterprise Server last fall, we have improved the knowledge management, collaboration, and administrative tools and added significant functional enhancements that enable businesses to quickly improve productivity and the delivery of information throughout their organizations."&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;New Features&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;NewsGator Enterprise Server 1.3 includes the following new capabilities:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;Knowledge Management and Relevancy&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;SharePoint Team Portal integration – This feature enables the publishing of a set of feeds to a Microsoft SharePoint portal site that members of a group can view.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;Group Clippings – This knowledge management feature allows a member of an internal team or group to take important items, add a comment, and drop them into a folder, which is then turned into an RSS feed to which others can subscribe. This increases productivity by enabling many to benefit from the work and effort undertaken by an individual.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;Refined article and feed searching – Users can customize searches for only internally generated/published content (versus all content indexed internally) and define SmartFeeds (keyword searches) in the same way.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;Feed creation from email – Users can easily turn emails into RSS feeds.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;Improved user interface – New look and feel, improved navigation and support for favicons (icons from feed publishers).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;Administration&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;Directory servers – Read and manage groups from multiple directory servers.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;Proxy scripting – The ability to dynamically determine proxy information and multiple URLs as internal (and not to be accessed through proxy).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;Taxonomy management – Taxonomy editing through UI – Administrators can add and delete categories to the taxonomy (categories of feeds) and feeds to categories through the user interface and also add secure feeds which subscribers can access by entering credentials.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;Globalization&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;Localization – Allows organizations to customize the software for foreign languages.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;Pricing and Availability&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;NewsGator Enterprise Server 1.3 is currently available and priced on a per-user basis. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;About NewsGator Technologies, Inc.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=1&gt;NewsGator Technologies is the world’s leading RSS platform company.

      <summary>These two new shirts are available in sizes Small to XX-Large in heavy-weight black cotton for USD$16.90.
